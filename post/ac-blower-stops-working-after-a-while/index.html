The blower control would randomly change from dash level air to the split flow (dash and floor) right before it would stop blowing. After a while, the vacuum will be stronger than your carburetor’s ability to pump fuel and the engine will die. Just wanted to share my experience with the intermittent running blower. There may be a safety system that shuts off the blower motor if the back pressure is too high.

If it isn’t running either, check the breaker.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title ac blower stops working after a while by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
