I suspect it’s the blower motor, let me tell you why: The refrigerant is what keeps the cabin cool. Here are the fuse locations as well:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/48/af/e648afeaa6cc68846a34caea46d1183b.jpg alt="Go Look Importantbook Electronic Water Conditioner Ac Amnimarjeslow Al Do Four Do Al One Ljbusaf Th Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Ac System" title="Go Look Importantbook Electronic Water Conditioner Ac Amnimarjeslow Al Do Four Do Al One Ljbusaf Th Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Ac System" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Most cars are designed to have the radiator cooling fan kick in when the a/c is on. My cooling fan is not working properly while ac running and ac is not cool. Whether you hear a faint, rattling, or grinding noise when your ac or heater is blowing lightly, or one that’s so bad it seems like your dashboard is vibrating when you have it turned up, it doesn’t necessarily mean something serious is wrong. If one or both pressure readings are out of range, this is verification your vehicle has a non working air conditioner.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/35/1a/6a/351a6a2c60ee2b410de5985abba95d48.jpg alt="Penyebab Ac Mobil Tidak Dingin Dan Bau Serta Cara Mengatasinya Air Conditioning System Car Air Conditioning Ac Repair Services" title="Penyebab Ac Mobil Tidak Dingin Dan Bau Serta Cara Mengatasinya Air Conditioning System Car Air Conditioning Ac Repair Services" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If it’s not working, the fan won’t turn on when it needs to, which means the engine might overheat. That means a trickle out of your vents instead of the rush you asked for. So that points to a relay or something. That’s why your ac is not cool.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title ac fan not working in car by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
