Alternating current (ac) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (dc) which flows only in one direction.

An inverter drive (vfd) works by taking ac mains (single or three phase) and first rectifying it into dc, the dc is usually smoothed with capacitors and often a dc choke before it is connected to a network of power transistors to turn it into three phases for the motor.
