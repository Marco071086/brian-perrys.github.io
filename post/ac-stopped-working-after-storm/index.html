Refrigerant doesn’t get used up (the way your car uses gasoline) or wear out and need to be replaced (like your motor oil). An hvac pro will need to inspect the system to see why the condensate line was clogging. Most likely, a power surge from the storm overloaded the ac’s circuit, causing the circuit breaker to “trip.” so you’ll need to reset it.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e8/b2/be/e8b2be8e795ec94d8cc1d0ce3404d365--thunderstorms-air-conditioners.jpg alt="You Lost Power And Now Your Air Conditioner Is Not Working- Now What Hvac Unit Red Truck Air Conditioner" title="You Lost Power And Now Your Air Conditioner Is Not Working- Now What Hvac Unit Red Truck Air Conditioner" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: cz.pinterest.com</p><p>Here’s what to do if your ac stops working after a storm: If the refrigerant level gets too low, the a/c will still turn on and blow air; Most of the time, even the trickier issues can be fixed quickly. If so, reset the circuit breaker and allow the air conditioning system to run. If nothing was damaged during the power outage, your system should turn back on successfully.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title ac stopped working after storm by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
