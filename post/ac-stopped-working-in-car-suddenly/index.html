If your car ac is working, but it’s not cooling as it used to, you might be looking at a blocked/damaged condenser.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/43/4b/26/434b2636336d1f895a88c45ba4e21864.jpg alt="Air Conditioning Station For Diagnostic Of Freon Car Air Conditioning Car Automobile" title="Air Conditioning Station For Diagnostic Of Freon Car Air Conditioning Car Automobile" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
