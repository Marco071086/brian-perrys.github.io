Check for incorrect electrical wiring. Look for and address simple reasons why the thermostat isn’t getting power, such as dead batteries or a tripped breaker or blown fuse in your main electrical service panel. If your thermostat does not work after changing the batteries, or if it does not come back on, then this means your thermostat is not getting any power. This debris can get trapped just behind the cover of your thermostat and cause some major problems.
