The training improves performance on cognitive tasks requiring working memory and attention, and also improves attention.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5e/e6/e4/5ee6e42525a092880d2f35d878d98112.gif alt="8 Week Online Computer Program To Help Children Between 7 And 16 To Improve Memory Fee Based Working Memory Memory Games For Kids Memory Strategies" title="8 Week Online Computer Program To Help Children Between 7 And 16 To Improve Memory Fee Based Working Memory Memory Games For Kids Memory Strategies" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
