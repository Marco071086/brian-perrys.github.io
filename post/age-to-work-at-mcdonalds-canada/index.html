Employees under the age of 15 years of age may work a maximum of 12 hours per week during the school term (30 hours per week during school holidays), with each shift being a maximum of 3 hours (6 hours during school holidays). 30% of answers mention the age limit is 16 years see answers.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title age to work at mcdonalds canada by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
