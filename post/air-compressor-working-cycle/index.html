Compressor and turbine isentropic efﬁciencies are 0:85.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/08/60/65/086065926ed42067873af7959e5fceb2.jpg alt="Httpsthumbsdreamstimecomzsupercharger-works-air-compressor -increases-pressure-density-air-suppli In 2021 Car Mechanic Automotive Mechanic Automobile Engineering" title="Httpsthumbsdreamstimecomzsupercharger-works-air-compressor -increases-pressure-density-air-suppli In 2021 Car Mechanic Automotive Mechanic Automobile Engineering" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Determine (a) the thermal efficiency of the cycle, (b) the back work ratio, (c) the net power developed, in kw. Cold air from refrigerated space is drawn into the compressor and compressed to the cooler pressure. Take for air c v = 0.71 kj/kg k and c p = 1.0 kj/kg k. When the working fluid enters into a diffuser which changes the speed of the fluid into pressure energy.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title air compressor working cycle by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
