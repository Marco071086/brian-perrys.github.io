Diaphragm compressor working cycle during the working of the diaphragm compressor, each revolution of the piston delivers a certain amount of hydraulic oil to the membrane or diaphragm. The casing for the compressor is so designed that kinetic energy of the air is converted into pressure energy before it leaves the casing.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f8/61/f1/f861f1dc48270c72891da8e620d6db3c.jpg alt="Learn About The Operation Of An Air Compressor With The Help Of Diagrams For Every Stroke Of The Piston Also Compare You Air Compressor Compressor Inlet Valve" title="Learn About The Operation Of An Air Compressor With The Help Of Diagrams For Every Stroke Of The Piston Also Compare You Air Compressor Compressor Inlet Valve" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

A bypass pipe should be put in place to continue the transportation of compressed air when maintenance needs to be completed. The first element is symbol that indicate electrical component in the circuit. The compressing medium or ‘gas.
