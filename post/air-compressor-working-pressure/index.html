It further grants power to the motor as long as system pressure is below the preset settings. It may have a max rating of 60 psi or whatever it is, but even under airbrush loads, only be able to maintain 30 Then, the air is forced through an opening in the tank, where pressure builds up.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/6f/a1/f96fa1ab8fe6eb1c3ffe72ffc470206c.jpg alt="Ka Series Piston Air Compressor Power22kw - 30kw Working Pressure08mpa 125mpa Free Air Delivery0 Air Compressor Gas Compressor Portable Air Compressor" title="Ka Series Piston Air Compressor Power22kw - 30kw Working Pressure08mpa 125mpa Free Air Delivery0 Air Compressor Gas Compressor Portable Air Compressor" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
