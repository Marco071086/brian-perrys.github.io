Several internal problems with your air conditioning unit could be causing the fan to fail (and thereby causing the loss of cold air indoors) these issues include:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://inspectapedia.com/aircond/CompressorOld010DJF.jpg alt="Hissing Air Conditioner Or Heat Pump Noise Cause Hvac Noise Descriptions Recordings" title="Hissing Air Conditioner Or Heat Pump Noise Cause Hvac Noise Descriptions Recordings" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
