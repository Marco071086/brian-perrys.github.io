Because it flips by a magnet, when the magnet goes bad the switch does not work. If it is in the air conditioning mode, check for ice around the evaporator coil and on the refrigerant lines at the indoor unit. Check out the thermostat and see if the display is working. The evaporator coil sits inside your home within the air handler unit (furnace or fan coil), pulling heat and humidity from indoor air.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title air conditioner fan not working inside by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
