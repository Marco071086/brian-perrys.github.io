Open itunes (on pcs or macs running macos mojave 10.14 or earlier) or finder (macs running macos catalina 10.15 or newer).; For the airdrop feature to work, both the sending and receiving devices need to be compatible with the feature.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://1reddrop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/AirDrop-1024x572.jpeg alt="Airdrop Not Working Here Is The Fix" title="Airdrop Not Working Here Is The Fix" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
