Source: natwest.com</p><p>Check for any pending software update on iphone After you erase a device, you can�t track its location, so make sure you no longer need to search for the device. In your situation, provided you received an email confirming your iphone is in lost mode, apple pay will be disabled and unusable on this device until lost mode is turned off. The watch may have lost connection with the iphone, and hence the feature is not working. This will automatically disable payment information within apple pay.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.starlingbank.com/static/apple-watch-phone-3f0d5240977f599532b37119b6bd9098.png alt="Using Apple Pay With Starling - Starling Bank" title="Using Apple Pay With Starling - Starling Bank" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
