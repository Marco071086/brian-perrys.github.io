In the my watch tab, tap wallet & apple pay. Usually, an issue with a card may happen if you made some changes to its information, and the same is somehow not registered on apple pay’s database.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bf/44/5e/bf445e5bd755bbbeb9f49cc0042bc840.jpg alt="Nyc Bus Time App Mta Kongchinnavigationios Bus Times App Iphone Games" title="Nyc Bus Time App Mta Kongchinnavigationios Bus Times App Iphone Games" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
