However, another sound issue that some apple tv owners have ran into with disney plus is that there is background noise but when the people on tv speak, no sound comes out. One option would be the victony 4k x 2k hdmi to hdmi and optical toslink spdif + 3.5mm stereo audio extractor converter for $28.99 in addition to the optical splitter. The biggest omission to the apple tv app is netflix.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://appuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-04_164235.png alt="Apple Tv Vs Amazon Fire Tv Stick - Appualscom" title="Apple Tv Vs Amazon Fire Tv Stick - Appualscom" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
