Homepod doesn�t have any wired inputs, and it won�t work as a normal bluetooth speaker without some hacking with a raspberry pi.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KSFcRyBTSabYA96QaHMVZX.jpg alt="New Apple Tv 4k 2021 Vs Old Apple Tv 4k Should You Upgrade What Hi-fi" title="New Apple Tv 4k 2021 Vs Old Apple Tv 4k Should You Upgrade What Hi-fi" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: whathifi.com</p><p>Hopefully apple will update this to work with the rear camera for projectors. However, another sound issue that some apple tv owners have ran into with disney plus is that there is background noise but when the people on tv speak, no sound comes out. Turn off bluetooth or if already off, try turning it on. When i plug in my apple tv to the projector (by way of hdmi), i can see the picture but have no sound. Update ios, apple tv, and homepod software.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title apple tv sound not working on projector by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
