Make sure the furnace is on we mentioned earlier that it might be a smart idea to cut off the flow of power to your furnace during an outage. The most obvious reason an electric heater doesn’t work is that it’s not receiving any power. Check to make sure that any gfi outlets attached to or near the furnace have not tripped. Try resetting the thermostat by first bringing it down to zero.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/ac/b3/c4acb3647cfef34e60e0b56588061a44.png alt="Mysa Smart Thermostat For Electric Baseboard Heaters - - Amazoncom Baseboard Heater Electric Baseboard Heaters Smart Thermostats" title="Mysa Smart Thermostat For Electric Baseboard Heaters - - Amazoncom Baseboard Heater Electric Baseboard Heaters Smart Thermostats" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you notice that the baseboard heater is not working after a power outage you should check to see if the settings are correct.
