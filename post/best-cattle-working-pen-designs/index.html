From the first moment that cattle enter the pens, all the way to the squeeze chute, arrowquip’s cattle handling systems are designed with animal science and quality engineering at the forefront for a safer and more efficient cattle working experience. Developed by bud williams, this system takes advantage of instinctive cattle behaviors. The race will hold two adult cattle plus one in the crush, while the forcing yard holds around seven head. The “bud box” design reminds me of the much older systems when all cattle were worked in large pens on horseback.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f8/ba/3b/f8ba3beb7bf94a1dce9b36db8204711c.jpg alt="Corral System 7497 Cattle Ranching Cattle Corrals Show Cattle Barn" title="Corral System 7497 Cattle Ranching Cattle Corrals Show Cattle Barn" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
