As christian business owners, we are to be a positive example of being people with integrity, not engaging in false promises and manipulation. The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps.” proverbs 15:22:</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title bible verses about ethics in business by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
