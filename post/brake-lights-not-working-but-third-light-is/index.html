Source: pinterest.com</p><p>The circuit litterally goes from the brake switch straight to the multifunction switch. If no lights work at all it leans toward the switch which controls all or them to activate hence the brake light switch. Autozone told me maybe my brake light switch is out so i changed it but still not working. I have had two mobile mechanics from craigslist look at the problem in the last few days. It cant be a brake switch because the two other brake lights work?</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f5/36/f5/f536f5cb09c701ee696351124c7ad531.jpg alt="35 Unique Third Brake Light Wiring Diagram Strobe Lights Strobing Diagram" title="35 Unique Third Brake Light Wiring Diagram Strobe Lights Strobing Diagram" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Went underneath and checked the air brake switch, i used a jumper wire on the terminals and only the third brake works when. Anyone know what the resolution to this thread was? I checked the fuses and they are good. Noticed that my brake lights are not working, but the third brake light works.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/8e/e8/3e8ee81bd95b4289cef04a584ed586b8.jpg alt="Chrome Housing Smoked Lens Led Rear Cargo3rd Third Brake Light For 15-18 Canyon In 2021 Lens Chrome Led" title="Chrome Housing Smoked Lens Led Rear Cargo3rd Third Brake Light For 15-18 Canyon In 2021 Lens Chrome Led" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>After a few weeks, the brake lights stopped working again, but 3rd brake light is still working. If the tail lights work with turn signals then is has to be the multifunction switch. After replacing the switch in the column, the brake lights worked beautifully for some time until recently. Don�t rule out the possibility that both bulbs are burnt out. It�s primarily a problem with the turn signal switch since the hazards and stop lights both are on the same circuit.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title brake lights not working but third light is by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
