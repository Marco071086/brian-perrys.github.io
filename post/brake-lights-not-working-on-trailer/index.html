I unplugged tail lights to eliminate a bulb problem and still nothing. Trailer has separate turn signals that come on with brake lights; Caravan/trailer plugs are particularly vulnerable to damage from either rough tracks or being pulled in and out. I�ve check all fuses related to the tow package (1,3,5,19,&41) and all are good.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/80/a4/c780a400d2184069f729189b28a0c9ca.jpg alt="How To Add A Center Mounted Third Brake Light To A Trailer Trailer Light Wiring Trailer Wiring Diagram Wire" title="How To Add A Center Mounted Third Brake Light To A Trailer Trailer Light Wiring Trailer Wiring Diagram Wire" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The tow package wiring on a vehicle is separate from the tail light wiring so it makes sense that the truck brake lights are working. Lately, if you have standard not led lights i find soldering the ends of the wires before fitting them into the light fittings seems to give good long term results and keeping them working seems to helped by not drowning them. I tested the trailer on another vehicle and the brake lights work.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8b/4e/d8/8b4ed8b4c9b6ab7dac4eb21ae7a9b29e.jpg alt="Finally Solved The Case Of The Intermittent Trailer Running Lights Trailer Wiring Diagram Trailer Light Wiring Utility Trailer" title="Finally Solved The Case Of The Intermittent Trailer Running Lights Trailer Wiring Diagram Trailer Light Wiring Utility Trailer" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Troubleshooting vehicle and trailer wiring is easiest if you check the vehicle and the trailer individually when they are not connected to one another. It is probably a ground issue.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title brake lights not working on trailer by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
