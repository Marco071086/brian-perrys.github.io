Diy cajun gun works pro package trigger test & review. I ordered a few extras besides the pro package, 10x bushing, stainless guide rod, 85 combat trigger, and adjustable sights. Da/sa weights and length of travel were reduced. Everything you need to transform your full size or compact cz to a smooth, crisp, safe, reliable, and durable pistoll.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cajun-2.jpeg alt="Cz Sp-01 Tactical Update - A Cajunized Masterpiece -the Firearm Blog" title="Cz Sp-01 Tactical Update - A Cajunized Masterpiece -the Firearm Blog" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Single actions are 3lbs 8 oz and double actions are 7lbs 14oz. Everything you need to transform your cz to a smooth 8lb da (double action), crisp 3lb 8oz sa (single action), and cuts the sa reset 50%.

Parts include a new firing pin spring, firing pin, firing pin block stop spring, firing pin roll pin, trigger, trigger return spring, hammer, main spring, firing pin block lever and disconnector. I believe so strongly in his parts that i decided to purchase a new gun because i found out that he was going to manufacture parts for it. That is the cheapest way to end up with an awesome, pro grade trigger.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://cdn1.cajungunworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21095628/P-01-Decocker-2-800x800.jpg alt="Cz P-01 - Decocker - Cajun Gun Works" title="Cz P-01 - Decocker - Cajun Gun Works" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I�m curious about the differences between the packages offered by cajun gun works and cz custom. If you want a custom 1911 quality trigger, get the flat trigger, delete the fpb and add the spacer in place of the fpb lifter in the sear pack.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title cajun gun works pro package by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
