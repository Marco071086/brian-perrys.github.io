The gun was silky smooth from the factory, but i kept hearing what amazing things cajun gun works do to cz handguns. He felt that the included night sights were the best i could ever do on this gun, and that cz including them is a great move and saves the buyer money in the long run.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d7/f9/07/d7f9076f86603cb2ab189b4faa1df5dc.jpg alt="Pin On Weapons" title="Pin On Weapons" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
