Source: dallasemploymentlawyer.com</p><p>Say the boss doesn�t like your shoes? It does not make a difference whether the employee actually did anything wrong. Under these laws, employers have the legal right to fire an employee for any reason they see fit or for no reason at all. Despite the existence of these laws, exceptions still apply to termination situations that limit an employer’s ability to fire an employee under certain circumstances. Basically this means that, unless you have an employment contract, you can be fired or you can quit at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/78/2c/df/782cdfdefefe9c26474447fd6b88593c.jpg alt="Pin On Save Our Earth" title="Pin On Save Our Earth" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you have been wrongfully terminated for the purpose of avoiding paying earned bonuses or commissions due, these are the most common defenses that can be mounted by your employer to defend himself/herself against your wrongful termination claim: Often times, the comical example used to demonstrate this is that in texas, you can be fired for coming into work wearing a red clown nose.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.rbisenberg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/faqs-can-you-lose-your-job-in-texas-if-you-get-a-dwi.jpg alt="Can You Lose Your Job In Texas If You Get A Dwi Randall Isenberg" title="Can You Lose Your Job In Texas If You Get A Dwi Randall Isenberg" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

In “at will employment” states, employers can fire employees without demonstrating a “just cause.” that means you can be fired for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. However, even in at will states, employers cannot fire you for illegal reasons. You may experience shock, anger, sadness, worry, and fear about the future. An implied contract can be formed based on clear statements made by the employer that they have a secured job and cannot be fired for just any reason.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/da/b5/09dab51b446eb771b6b74d3a5d812a9b.png alt="Pin De Iman Douiri Em Post Tatuagem Masculina Braco Masculino" title="Pin De Iman Douiri Em Post Tatuagem Masculina Braco Masculino" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

For example, if your texas employer fires you for discriminatory reasons, in violation of an employment contract, or in retaliation for exercising your rights, you may have a legal claim for wrongful termination. The fact that a male temp is brought in for a higher pay is irrelevant unless you can show she is fired for sex discrimination.
