It�s much better for you to get your protein from whole food sources. You don’t need to replace them. As you have seen from the human case studies above, consuming a whey protein shake alone before or after your workout will not encourage additional muscle growth or increase strength as long as your daily protein intake is adequate.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cd/c6/b9/cdc6b9258ae347e10523cea7630c2c70.png alt="Pin On Healthy Living" title="Pin On Healthy Living" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If your bmr was 2.4k, you could consume 2 scoops of those and remain at the same weight. But if you want to consume protein from your diet and have recovery also i would suggest consuming eggs. Gym goers require protein for muscle repair and recovery rather than muscle development. Many people are easily deluded that they can increase their muscles’ level by simply drinking whey protein without working out.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/b1/8f/0fb18faa73d6d74936526bea8bb38e29.jpg alt="10 Best Whey Protein Supplements For Bodybuilding" title="10 Best Whey Protein Supplements For Bodybuilding" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
