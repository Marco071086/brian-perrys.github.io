The most common problems that will cause your car horn not to work are either the horn itself is bad or the clock spring mounted behind the steering wheel is bad. The horn on ford fiesta needs electricity to work. If the horn makes a clicking sound, the problem could be a poor ground connection.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/83/93/cc8393bb1f4fd9c29864607e41cd73aa.jpg alt="Hotrods Bobbers Choppers Bobber Motorcycle Bobber Chopper Motorcycle Wiring" title="Hotrods Bobbers Choppers Bobber Motorcycle Bobber Chopper Motorcycle Wiring" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

After some fiddling around in the cramped engine bay, i chose to give it a whack and hey presto! If the fuse blows, you’ve got a bum horn. Ive searched a fault on here due to lights etc and some sort of module in the steering wheel, but ive tried turning all the lights at different settings and horn fails to work, checked fuse.
