First check that the fuses are good, it uses the ones in the chart below depending on which unit you have. The car need to be jump started this morning. Removing the battery in many newer vehicles will trigger the various anti theft features.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/61/a5/3261a5194e5768d4af25f4df53931614.jpg alt="Retevis Rt9000d Mobile Car Radio Station 60w 50ctcss1024dcs Vox Scan With Programming Cable Ham Radio Receiver A9100 In 2021 Radio Car Radio Ham Radio" title="Retevis Rt9000d Mobile Car Radio Station 60w 50ctcss1024dcs Vox Scan With Programming Cable Ham Radio Receiver A9100 In 2021 Radio Car Radio Ham Radio" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The owners manual says to wait at least 10 minuites and it should resync but it doesn�t. Remove the battery cables from the battery. Otherwise if you can�t find it (or the old owner) you will have to contact the car company�s customer service line.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title car radio not working after battery replacement by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
