We have an older model howard miller grandfather clock that will often times not chime on the hour but simply strike the time. Carefully pull the hammers back and see if the train starts running. The hammer heads are on wires just for this reason.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/a3/75/97a375a6633d584e6dfafb63f7f8f6e9.jpg alt="Conteporary Quartz Chime Aged Dial Cherry Wall Clock 625377 Arendal Howard Miller Wall Clock Chiming Wall Clocks Wall Clock" title="Conteporary Quartz Chime Aged Dial Cherry Wall Clock 625377 Arendal Howard Miller Wall Clock Chiming Wall Clocks Wall Clock" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The 1/4 hour chimes work fine. At the core of every grandfather pendulum clock is its movement. When battery operated clocks stop working, it’s usually caused by one or more of the batteries.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kp2Ll7YJ3qw/maxresdefault.jpg alt="How To Fix Clock That Doesnt Chime On The Correct Minute - Youtube Clock Clock Repair Wooden Clock" title="How To Fix Clock That Doesnt Chime On The Correct Minute - Youtube Clock Clock Repair Wooden Clock" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Additionally, the chime notes are often not correct; Repair of a battery operated clock typically comes down to the batteries and the battery compartment, making the fix.

About 3 months ago my wife raised the weights for the first time. If the hammers are rubbing the back of the clock case, or if there hitting or rubbing against each other, the clock will hang up and not chime. If you�d rather not hear your clock�s chimes at all, you don�t have to lose the clock function in the process.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/d0/9b/e2d09bc0293b4002b5e8594a3fd23e9a.jpg alt="Pin On Klokken" title="Pin On Klokken" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When battery operated clocks stop working, it’s usually caused by one or more of the batteries. The minute hand should be removed and adjusted. Don, it could be that the change in weight on the chime train caused it to lock up.
