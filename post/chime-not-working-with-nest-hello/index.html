This sets the nest hello apart from the ring doorbell series (which doesn’t have a hardwired chime, although a standalone wifi chime can be purchased and plugged into a wall socket). Some people may not wish to allow this, of course. If you only have batteries, it may not work. You will wear the doorbell click into place if you properly mount it.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b8/41/23/b841235e13f3f510931d0224fe705f7a.jpg alt="Is The Nest Hello Waterproof Smart Home Nest Smart Video" title="Is The Nest Hello Waterproof Smart Home Nest Smart Video" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you have a mechanical chime at home, turn on the electronic chime duration button in the app and press the nest doorbell button once. Turned the indoor chime back on, and the problem is back. I tried changing to the thanksgiving chime and it has the same problem. It must be the battery not able to compensate anymore for the power drop when the doorbell is pressed.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/34/91/db/3491db67c19068f0a1a50f778573c638.jpg alt="Google Nest Nest Hello Doorbell With Google Hub Buildcom Google Nest Best Smart Home Doorbell" title="Google Nest Nest Hello Doorbell With Google Hub Buildcom Google Nest Best Smart Home Doorbell" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
