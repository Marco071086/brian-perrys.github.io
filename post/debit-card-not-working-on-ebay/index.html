Your paisapay credit / debit card payment cannot be completed. Your card details are correct. I don�t know what�s the problem but i am unable to use my visa credit card here on ebay. Make sure your ebay and pay pal accounts are linked,see here, to link your ebay account to your paypal account:</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title debit card not working on ebay by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
