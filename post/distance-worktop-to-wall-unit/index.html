Ikea offer a 200cm or 220cm height for a tall unit and 60/80. I�ve chalked the wall units 550mm from the worktop for now but that means the bottom of the wall unit will be just under 1.5m from the floor. If you follow the best practices for designing your kitchen, you should allow for at least 400mm (40cm) clearance between the worktop surface and the bottom of the wall units, leaving enough space on the worktop for keeping small appliances. A corresponding batten should be fixed to the wall at approximately 600mm above a 900mm worktop, to hold the cupboard straight.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/2e/64/7e2e648fe54a34b32fa20904a8cee75a.jpg alt="Large Kitchen Island Incorporating Two Different Worktop Shapes And Col Kitchen Island Different Colour Kitchen Island With Seating Kitchen Remodel Countertops" title="Large Kitchen Island Incorporating Two Different Worktop Shapes And Col Kitchen Island Different Colour Kitchen Island With Seating Kitchen Remodel Countertops" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
