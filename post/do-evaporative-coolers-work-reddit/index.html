The process is the same for the air around an evaporative cooler. An evaporative cooler operates by releasing water vapor into the atmosphere to minimize the temperature. While ac units do cost more to operate and use more energy, their major advantage is that they work in practically every type of climate.

Evaporative cooling units are simple and work by pulling air through the unit and passing it through wet pads, and as the water evaporates, it cools it, sending fresher cooler air into the room.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://me1065.wikidot.com/local--files/swamp-coolers/swampcooler1.jpg alt="Swamp Coolers - Thermal Systems" title="Swamp Coolers - Thermal Systems" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
