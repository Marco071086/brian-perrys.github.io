Satellite phones work pretty much anywhere, meaning if you travel between major cities and outback areas regularly, or even out on the water, you don’t have to.

Satellite phones work by connecting you through satellites positioned in low or high. And if you’re someone who travels to remote places so often that you need a satellite phone, chances are you could probably use the extra battery life too.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/61/dd/ec/61ddeceda55ec855ac6e18029bd8b662.jpg alt="Inmarsat Isatphone 2 Satellite Phone Satellite Phone Satellite Phones Phone" title="Inmarsat Isatphone 2 Satellite Phone Satellite Phone Satellite Phones Phone" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
