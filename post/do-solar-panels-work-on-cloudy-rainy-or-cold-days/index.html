If you have any other light source in your outdoor space, however—like solar lights—you don’t need solar panels to make these items function. If you live in an area with a strong net metering policy , excess energy generated by your panels during sunny hours will offset energy that you use at night and other times when your system isn�t operating at full capacity.
