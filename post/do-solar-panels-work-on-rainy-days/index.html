However, if its pitch dark, there is no way a solar panel can produce electricity on that particular day. Your solar panels simply perform better during the summer than the monsoon season.

However, since the sky is generally covered in thick, dark clouds when it rains, solar panels can only produce up to about 20% of their rated output power.
