In the winter, it’s also less likely for solar panels to reach their peak temperature, or peak power. Since solar panels work with light, not heat, it doesn’t matter how cold it gets outside. In the simplest panels, sun heats water flowing in a circuit through the collector (the panel on your roof). Climates where temperatures routinely drop below freezing require a specific type of solar hot water heater that is not necessary in warmer climates.

But how do solar panels stand up to harsh winter conditions? Do solar panels work in the winter?
