Crest white strips can remove decades’ worth of stains, and they work well at making your teeth two or three shades lighter than before using them. Do not use with dental braces. Buying whitening strips at $50 every six months would cost about $200 over a two year period.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/ed/e4/c2ede4a6fae769930653659e1c948d08.jpg alt="Pin On Teeth Whitening" title="Pin On Teeth Whitening" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
