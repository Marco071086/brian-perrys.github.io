Source: appuals.com</p><p>For the record, i personally have adblock. However, be sure you are using youtube.com from a browser instead of the youtube app. The tv does not allow the youtube app to be modified. The main reason people are upset about adblock not working on youtube is because everyone who is using this tool is getting long, unskippable ads which usually last around a minute and a half while other users are able to skip them right after five seconds. + loads videos and youtube website faster.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title does adblock work on youtube tv by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
