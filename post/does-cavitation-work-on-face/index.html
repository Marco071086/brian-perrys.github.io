How does ultrasonic cavitation work? Rf can also be used in conjunction with ultrasound cavitation to aid in further fat breakdown and also to tighten the skin in the same area the cavitation treatment has taken place. This effect is possible because of the weak structural capacity of fat cells, which cannot withstand the pressure caused by the vibrations, thereby imploding the cells into a liquid form.
