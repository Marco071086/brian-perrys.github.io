Well, to clear this confusion in your mind with a yes or no is difficult. Drinking a protein shake without working out doesn�t offer any benefit over getting protein from whole foods. Some people believe in this “anabolic window”, or the ideal timeframe in which you’re supposed to consume protein after exercise because your muscles will soak it up the most. Additionally, if you drink one before you work out, you’re giving your body the essential amino acids it needs to help repair and rebuild muscle fibers that get damaged or stressed during heavy exercise. Since protein contains calories, consuming too much can actually make losing weight more difficult — especially if you drink protein shakes in addition to your usual diet, and you�re not exercising.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/d9/60/09d9608a5d96032c08eff01d86c32ec0.jpg alt="Fitness Fitnessmotivation Fitnessmodel Fitnessaddict Fitnessgirl Fitnessjourney Fitnesslifestyle Natural Protein Shakes Protein Shakes Natural Protein" title="Fitness Fitnessmotivation Fitnessmodel Fitnessaddict Fitnessgirl Fitnessjourney Fitnesslifestyle Natural Protein Shakes Protein Shakes Natural Protein" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
