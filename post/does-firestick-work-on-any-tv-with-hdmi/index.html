I have an amazon firestick and i want to use it on an older tv without hdmi. Just found it odd that an old now tv box (now bricked) worked fine with hdmi, and the firestick didn’t on any of the display settings. Almost all laptops have an hdmi port. The firestick works on my ks8500on connect hub.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/ab/fe/46abfe111ab3187af95ef2d3633093df.jpg alt="Fire Tv Stick Streaming Alexa Remote Hd In 2020 Fire Tv Stick Amazon Fire Tv Stick Tv Stick" title="Fire Tv Stick Streaming Alexa Remote Hd In 2020 Fire Tv Stick Amazon Fire Tv Stick Tv Stick" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

You take the hdmi cable, which is connected to the stick, and connect it to the hdmi port on your set. First, you should physically connect your firestick to the lg smart tv and the power source. You can either connect the firestick directly to your tv or use the short included hdmi cable if you need more space. Plug the firestick into the hdmi port on your television.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/31/4f/7e314f3ca510fab3e1c4f359945aab46.jpg alt="21 Amazon Fire Tv Tips For Streaming Fans Amazon Fire Tv Fire Tv Fire Tv Stick" title="21 Amazon Fire Tv Tips For Streaming Fans Amazon Fire Tv Fire Tv Fire Tv Stick" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Firesticks require the tv to have a hdmi port and for the tv to be a hdtv with at least 720p resolution. And it won’t be that hard since a lot of tvs already have an hdmi port. Now, please shut the tv off and unplug it from power. Technically yes, you can use roku even with an older tv version.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5a/07/ed/5a07edb734e9363e208834b4b0ff4674.jpg alt="How Does The Fire Stick Work Amazon Fire Tv Tv Connect Fire Tv" title="How Does The Fire Stick Work Amazon Fire Tv Tv Connect Fire Tv" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
