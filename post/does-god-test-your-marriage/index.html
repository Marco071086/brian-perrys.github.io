Nothing comes before your spouse. Marriage is a means of serving and glorifying god. Marriage mirrors god’s covenant relationship with his people.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/4c/b0/774cb036aa3c5a1314a7d9cd105cefd5.jpg alt="Making The Hard Choice To Protect My Marriage - Managing Your Blessings Healthy Marriage Marriage Advice Christian Marriage Life" title="Making The Hard Choice To Protect My Marriage - Managing Your Blessings Healthy Marriage Marriage Advice Christian Marriage Life" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: fr.pinterest.com</p><p>Just as a test in school is not meant to teach you something but rather gauge how well you have learned the content, so too does god use tests to make us aware of what we need to work on with him. Young women who view marriage as their chief goal are turning the wedding and the married state into an idol. Regardless of how good a match we marry, god is present, teaching encouraging us to love selflessly. God still tests us today. If you know god doesn’t not want you to marry this person, you should breakup.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title does god test your marriage by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
