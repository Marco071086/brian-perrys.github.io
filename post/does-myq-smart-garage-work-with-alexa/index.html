Thanks for the tip on alexa, i don’t have any amazon devices myself, but i was always curious if it would work with alexa voice commands. The base model, chamberlain myq does not work with alexa by itself. Set smart devices such as your thermostat or lighting to adjust when you open or close the garage door. Why does chamberlain myq not work with alexa itself?</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/18/94/a8/1894a85ac4bccb5b18352f54e5238a14.jpg alt="Does Nest Work With Alexa Which Devices - Smart Home Focus Amazon Alexa Skills Smart Home Alexa Enabled Devices" title="Does Nest Work With Alexa Which Devices - Smart Home Focus Amazon Alexa Skills Smart Home Alexa Enabled Devices" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

After a series of complaints from their users, chamberlain releases a statement denying the liability of this option stating the incompatibility is made for security considerations. Why does chamberlain myq not work with alexa itself? I can�t close the garage door or get status from alexa. In short, (without some loopholes) you can�t use alexa voice control to open or close your smart garage.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9d/88/1f/9d881f8fac5e11088e9f861b538f0e91.jpg alt="Myq Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain Myq-g0301 Amazon Cloud Cam Key Smart Garage Kit Key In-garag Smart Garage Door Opener Garage Door Opener Garage" title="Myq Smart Garage Door Opener Chamberlain Myq-g0301 Amazon Cloud Cam Key Smart Garage Kit Key In-garag Smart Garage Door Opener Garage Door Opener Garage" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
