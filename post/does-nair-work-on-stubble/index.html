You can use nair as often as you would normally shave, as both methods are similar in removing hair. Nair will work on hair stubble if it�s above the surface of the skin. After some time, the root will push out a new strand to the surface and creates stubble.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b9/7c/ca/b97cca095b75f3937ab751fee4b24aa9.jpg alt="Permanent Hair Removal Spray Hairremovaldiy Hair Removal Spray Hair Removal Permanent Body Hair Removal" title="Permanent Hair Removal Spray Hairremovaldiy Hair Removal Spray Hair Removal Permanent Body Hair Removal" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

After you are done wiping, clean your hands thoroughly with cold water. For stubble, that is short, or just at the skin’s surface, it may not be very effective. Nair can work to remove pubic hair, but should be removed with a soft cloth rather than the plastic spatula.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/25/aa/20/25aa20fde0c72118798d56d2aef69426--homemade-waxing-waxing-legs.jpg alt="Stand And Deliver Homemade Leg Wax Recipe Hair Removal Diy Sugar Waxing Sugar Wax Diy" title="Stand And Deliver Homemade Leg Wax Recipe Hair Removal Diy Sugar Waxing Sugar Wax Diy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
