Source: reviews.org</p><p>Yes, i know the echo does it… but i’m not switching my entire smarthome eco system for ring. I like the idea of getting the nest doorbell (battery) and then running wire from it to a transformer and a chime. If playback doesn�t begin shortly, try restarting your device. I was wondering if the nest audio or the google home mini would work as a chime just as. Please let us use smart speakers like google home as a doorbell chime or for motion notifications… while we’re talking about it, might as well let us use the speaker to speak through the doorbell too!</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/20/04/57/200457a9cab206ca250aeac8b0e3d64d.jpg alt="Enjoy Rock Bottom Prices On This Amazing Bundle Get Incredible Savings On The Latest Wireless Speaker Google Home Mini Video Doorbell Wireless Speakers" title="Enjoy Rock Bottom Prices On This Amazing Bundle Get Incredible Savings On The Latest Wireless Speaker Google Home Mini Video Doorbell Wireless Speakers" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Google offers its own video doorbell system called nest hello. I was looking at extending my ring video doorbell and adding home security but with no google support, i guess i will have to try and sell the current ring door bell second hand and buy new items that will work with google home.
