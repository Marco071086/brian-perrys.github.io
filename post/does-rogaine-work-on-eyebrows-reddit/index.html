Naysayers will claim that eyebrow hair will fall out after you stop using rogaine, while this is sometimes true with hair on your head, eyebrow hair is different. There aren�t a lot of reviews on minoxidil for women using this on their hair, and i believe it would be useful to do a review for those who would like to know. It makes hair grow back, similar to latisse for eyelashes (which by the way does work, thank you brooke shields). Since it promotes blood flow many times people see regrowth in their eyebrows. While it has not been fda approved to regrow or thicken eyebrows, some placebo controlled clinical studies suggest that minoxidil and rogaine can work on eyebrows.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://preview.redd.it/ej04j25p6z811.jpg?auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f36613d3eb1d457c58e6e23952d3174e3c41c672" alt="Ba Not Sure It This Is The Right Place For This But Eyebrow Transformation I Started Applying Rogaine Nightly With A Brush Around 5 Months Ago Rskincareaddiction" title="Ba Not Sure It This Is The Right Place For This But Eyebrow Transformation I Started Applying Rogaine Nightly With A Brush Around 5 Months Ago Rskincareaddiction" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
