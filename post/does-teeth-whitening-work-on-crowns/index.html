So, when you whiten your teeth with whitening products, your natural teeth may appear whiter than the veneers and crowns. I think that this is the ideal product. Teeth whitening wont work on crowns and such like, they wont change in colour, if the crowns are at the rear of your mouth it wont really matter as they wont be seen so dont worry about that, if you dont have your crowns yet you could get your teeth whitened first then get your crowns, that will mean though you will have to keep your teeth as. The natural teeth will whiten, and the tooth structure around any fillings or behind veneers will also lighten in color.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f1/3f/4c/f13f4cbe86bb821746ec85637d60ce92.jpg alt="The Top Picture Is Of The Old Crowns After Bleaching The Middle Picture Is Of The Temporaries Which Were Made Base Esthetics Picture Before And After Pictures" title="The Top Picture Is Of The Old Crowns After Bleaching The Middle Picture Is Of The Temporaries Which Were Made Base Esthetics Picture Before And After Pictures" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
