Plus, saturday delivery does not come with any extra cost. Ups customers ship packages, and the ups drivers work on the weekends around christmas to deliver the packages shipped by ups customers. With ups, shipping on weekends will cost you roughly the same amount of money as fedex, with a slight saving on the freight option. Many postal workers are even required to work on sundays.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f0/a4/8f/f0a48fac1a65b04133af8c29445c01ac.jpg alt="This Is The Best Plan For A Home Workout With Free Weekends And No Equipment Beginnersfitness Workout Plan At Home Workout Plan Fitness Body" title="This Is The Best Plan For A Home Workout With Free Weekends And No Equipment Beginnersfitness Workout Plan At Home Workout Plan Fitness Body" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
