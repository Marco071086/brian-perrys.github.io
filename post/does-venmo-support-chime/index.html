If you have a chime account that earnin is able to support, please make sure to turn on allow transactions in your chime settings. If you believe there may be something else going on causing chimespot me to not work, your best option is to contact chime support to try to diagnose the problem. We recommend linking to chime via debit card, and not by a bank (using chime routing and account numbers) because debit card transfers are instant whereas bank transfers can take up to 5 business days. Venmo has the edge over chime regarding rewards, as chime doesn’t offer cashback with its debit card.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://www.atimeforcash.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-link-your-chime-account-with-venmo-1.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:281x608/rscb121/ng:webp/ngcb121" alt="Does Chime Work With Venmo Complete 2021 Guide Atimeforcashnet" title="Does Chime Work With Venmo Complete 2021 Guide Atimeforcashnet" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
