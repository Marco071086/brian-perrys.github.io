Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Have a mechanic check the oil level. When gauge works (hot engine bay), it does not jiggle/wiggle, stays steady at 2/3rd position, lowers a little at idle, but not much. I had the timing belt changed at my local (trusted) mechanic and shortly after, my oil pressure went erratic. Complete the mounting of the gauge. Sometimes working, sometimes showing low, sometimes not at all.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/db/1e/fbdb1e2138b4b65f4dfd733a7efe4faf.jpg alt="Autometer Oil Pressure Gauge Wiring Diagram Oil Pressure Pressure Gauge Gauges" title="Autometer Oil Pressure Gauge Wiring Diagram Oil Pressure Pressure Gauge Gauges" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>I wired it up, just like what was on the back of it. The temperature sensor (it is an analog device, probably a thermistor), is located at the top of the engine, under the air cleaner assembly. Last year autometer cobalt oil pressure was sporadic. Also tested resistance on new sending unit and it is working properly. Not showing oil pressure on gauge.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/c1/9c/65c19c73c686d8e445a9de954e6852a2.jpg alt="Pin On Electrical Diagram" title="Pin On Electrical Diagram" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Have a mechanic check the oil level. Renewed sender unit, checked connection on back after cleaning terminal, wiring ok, wiring check on gauge done, fire up, reading fine, do three miles or so and oil pressure slowly drops to zero. I wired it up, just like what was on the back of it. It is very common that it�s. So i traced all the wiring, seems good.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title electric oil pressure gauge not working by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
