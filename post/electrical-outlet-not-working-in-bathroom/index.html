The light’s are working and only two gfi plugs in or out of the house and they both work. Immediately unplug anything with a connection to the outlet and turn off the breaker associated with the outlet. When a bathroom outlet stops working it is very possible that there is a gfci outlet that has tripped which causes the circuit to turn off.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title electrical outlet not working in bathroom by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
