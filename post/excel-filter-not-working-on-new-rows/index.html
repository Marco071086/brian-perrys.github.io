Use list rows present in a table action to sort, use filter array to filter, although the order of action changes, but the final result is the same. Try to filter it a second time and if there are still problems look for these: The reason is that currently excel does not support empty arrays. Second, besides using filter array after pulling all the data in the table, you could use a different excel list rows for each filter condition and combine them after like:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/73/5c/96735ca37a1bf16db9b97e3a5d0c7854.gif alt="In This Post We Will Learn How To Use The Advanced Filter Option Using Vba To Allow Us To Filter Our Data On A Sepa Microsoft Excel Tutorial Excel Excel Macros" title="In This Post We Will Learn How To Use The Advanced Filter Option Using Vba To Allow Us To Filter Our Data On A Sepa Microsoft Excel Tutorial Excel Excel Macros" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This range does not update upon the adding of rows or columns. When i apply filter for blank cells in one of my columns, it shows about 700,000 cells as blank and part of selection and am not able to delete these rows in one go or by breaking them into three parts. I�m guessing one of those rows kept getting put in the filter even though it was blank and that was causing the problem to begin with.

I worked around it by adding new rows at the end of the actual table (hit the tab key in the last table cell). In the following example we used the formula =filter(a5:d20,c5:c20=h2,) to return all records for apple, as selected in cell h2, and if there are no apples, return an empty string (). So in this case, after a certain row, the filter does not include them.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ea/81/0d/ea810d74e2912ef11957501a54ba5050.jpg alt="Prevent Excel From Freezing Or Taking A Long Time When Deleting Rows Excel Prevention How To Apply" title="Prevent Excel From Freezing Or Taking A Long Time When Deleting Rows Excel Prevention How To Apply" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
