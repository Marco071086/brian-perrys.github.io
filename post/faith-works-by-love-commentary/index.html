Remove or diminish love, and faith ceases to be what it should be. Good works are its rays. in summary, both faith and works are important in salvation. And love is the greatest because faith and hope can only work by love, and only show themselves by love.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c3/cb/eb/c3cbeb0fb6b2e65c6e4659ec6046ca6c.jpg alt="Excerpt From The Commentary Of My Study Bible Re Acts 23god Jesus Faith Godisincontrol In 2021 Who Is Jesus Bible Study Son Of God" title="Excerpt From The Commentary Of My Study Bible Re Acts 23god Jesus Faith Godisincontrol In 2021 Who Is Jesus Bible Study Son Of God" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Galatians 5:6 for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love. Yet not any sort of faith, but that which is operative, is attended with good works; The natural atmosphere for the operation of faith is love.
