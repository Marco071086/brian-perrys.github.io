Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Hello r/ford , i just bought at 2015 ford focus back at the end of september and have been enjoying it up until a week ago when the bluetooth stopped pairing and would just say disconnected. I ditched 2.2 as soon as i knew there was an upgrade and how to do it. Like you, i found bluetooth a bit touchy prior to 3.0. With the car running, disconnect the fuse for sync (which in my case is fuse f67). If this doesn’t solve the problem, you can try giving your sync a hard reset.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/a8/74/11a8747ba204353ee4be01490f754502.jpg alt="121 Android 71 Fast Boot Vertical Screen Navi Radio For Ford F-series 2015 - 2019 Trinity Auto Solution Ford Trucks F150 Ford Trucks Gmc Trucks" title="121 Android 71 Fast Boot Vertical Screen Navi Radio For Ford F-series 2015 - 2019 Trinity Auto Solution Ford Trucks F150 Ford Trucks Gmc Trucks" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
