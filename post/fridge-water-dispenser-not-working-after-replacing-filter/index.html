Source: missvickie.com</p><p>We changed the water filter on our ge refrigerator and immediately the water dispenser stopped working. Water filters eventually become clogged by the contaminants they screen out, restricting the flow of water to the dispenser. I gave the reservoir time to fill and i also held down the water dispensing mechanism for 5 minutes (at the request of ge customer service to make sure any air was pushed out of the tubing). Plenty of water goes into the filter cup, but none comes out.
