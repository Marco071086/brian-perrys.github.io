On ps4, i get this other consistent crash where it freezes during a random point in playback, if i happened to suspend another application to use it. Do i need to have a playstation®plus membership to use the funimation app? If you already had a funimation account before the migration you will need to use your funimation credentials, not your animelab password.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/funimation-featured.jpeg alt="Update Under Maintenance Funimation Siteserver Down Not Working Users Getting Unable To Connect Error - Piunikaweb" title="Update Under Maintenance Funimation Siteserver Down Not Working Users Getting Unable To Connect Error - Piunikaweb" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Easy way to fix it is deactivate your ps4 as primary, after it restarts, activate it as your primary, then it should open.
