Funimation not working on chrome if the issue is with your computer or a laptop you should try using restoro which can scan the repositories and replace corrupt and missing files. It is common for some problems to be reported throughout the day. Is this issue occurring with any other applications? Why do i keep getting authentication failed when i try to log in to the funimation roku channel?</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/24/cb/00/24cb00fd221f6da596b695bc7674558a--dragonball-z-budokai--dragon-ball-z.jpg alt="Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 Sony Playstation 2 Game Dragon Ball Z Dragonball Z Games Dbz Games" title="Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 Sony Playstation 2 Game Dragon Ball Z Dragonball Z Games Dbz Games" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Apparently i needed admin permission to initialize the app, so i had to run the app while signed into my admin account and sign into the app from there, and then i could switch back to my main account and sign in from there.
