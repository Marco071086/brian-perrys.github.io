On my roku device the subtitles lag the video by a good five seconds or so. Go to the settings on your tv and where ever caption settings are at make sure make sure caption mode is set to on 2 Secondly, there are many anime shows on funimation that are simply not available on sites like crunchyroll.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title funimation subtitles not working roku by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
