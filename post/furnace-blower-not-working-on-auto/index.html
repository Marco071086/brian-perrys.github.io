One can hear the thermostat click (basically saying its time to kick in) but the blower will not commence until i manually set it to on. The furnace control board should start the blower motor within 1 minute after igniting the burners. My furnace fan/blower will not work when set to the auto position. It doesn’t come on if in auto mode but if i put it in the on mode, the blower comes on and i have heat.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://upgradedhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1866092983.jpg alt="Furnace Blower Motor Hums But Wont Start We Have A Fix Upgraded Home" title="Furnace Blower Motor Hums But Wont Start We Have A Fix Upgraded Home" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The furnace control board should start the blower motor within 1 minute after igniting the burners. If the blower fan stops working, you have a more serious problem at hand. If the fan does not start, you have a wiring issue (circuit breaker trips) or motor problem (circuit breaker does not trip).</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hF-6faDzRyY/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Lennox Furnace Blower Motor Replacement Lx7920 - Youtube" title="Lennox Furnace Blower Motor Replacement Lx7920 - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Any help would be greatly appreciated. If the fan does not start, you have a wiring issue (circuit breaker trips) or motor problem (circuit breaker does not trip). It has worked in the past but not anymore.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/f5/46/a2/f546a208efe632b4791a447a963b075a.jpg alt="Blower Motor Resistor How It Works Symptoms Problems Testing Resistor Repair Furnace Maintenance" title="Blower Motor Resistor How It Works Symptoms Problems Testing Resistor Repair Furnace Maintenance" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

However, the fan will work when the thermostat is set to the on position. They always complain that their ac unit is running but the blower motor is not turning on. The blower will turn on if i turn the thermostat to the fan position.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title furnace blower not working on auto by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
