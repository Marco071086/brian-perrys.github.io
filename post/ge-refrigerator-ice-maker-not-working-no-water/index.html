They are the icemaker supply line burst valve and the water filter. This can result in no water or slow running water from the dispenser as well as to the icemaker. Shop water filters to confirm if there is a clogged filter: Once this is confirmed, select the water mode and turn off the lock mode by pressing and holding it.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/5e/11/1d5e1196116507afd670504f07c94461.jpg alt="Ice Maker Not Working - How To Troubleshoot Refrigerator Ice Cube Dispenser Samsung Refrigerator Refrigerator Ice Maker Ice Maker" title="Ice Maker Not Working - How To Troubleshoot Refrigerator Ice Cube Dispenser Samsung Refrigerator Refrigerator Ice Maker Ice Maker" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
