Someone on other forums suggested to replace the mother board for the dispenser. We tried putting the old filter back in, but no improvement. If the water inlet valve has sufficient pressure and is getting power, but the ice maker won’t fill with water to make ice, replace the water inlet valve.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/67/4b/64/674b6496500151005477fe5fa274f88a.jpg alt="How To Clean Water Dispenser Mold Diy Spring Cleaning Kitchen Water Dispenser Clean Water Dispenser" title="How To Clean Water Dispenser Mold Diy Spring Cleaning Kitchen Water Dispenser Clean Water Dispenser" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

For most ge refrigerator models, you can disable the lock feature by going to the “settings” and then tapping the “lock“ feature if it shows a lock icon. Seems like it is completely dead now. So what is happening is you press the ice paddle, nothing happens, you then press it a little subconsciously harder, and it in turn activates the water line as a sort of way to tell you something is not working. The ice maker gets water and the dispenser produces ice.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title ge refrigerator water dispenser not working but ice maker is by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
