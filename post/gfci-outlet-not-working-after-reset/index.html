If not you can gently remove the outlet from in the box and measure across the line side which should be power in. Sometimes., the reason behind gfci outlet not resetting is the issues in the other outlets. Look for bad or loose connections if at this point you still aren’t receiving power and the gfci outlet won’t reset, the next step is to look for any loose connections within the outlet itself.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/99/bf/b6/99bfb6e19cde511f5790c74beed6c7b7.jpg alt="Troubleshooting Dead Outlets And What To Do When Gfci Wont Reset Gfci Outlet Gfi Outlets" title="Troubleshooting Dead Outlets And What To Do When Gfci Wont Reset Gfci Outlet Gfi Outlets" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Also, if no power is reaching the gfi, it may not reset. However, if pressing reset doesn’t seem to do anything, then it’s time to contact an electrician. The reset button won�t work and the receptacle remains dead, even though the wiring to it is live. When these reset buttons fail, it likely means there is no power running to the gfci or that the gfci has been wired incorrectly.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b7/5f/2e/b75f2e5024484f76fd64ebf408c18022.jpg alt="Gfci Outlet Wont Reset What You Can Do And What You Shouldnt Do In 2021 Gfci Outlet What You Can Do" title="Gfci Outlet Wont Reset What You Can Do And What You Shouldnt Do In 2021 Gfci Outlet What You Can Do" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
