In genesis 50:20, joseph says to his brothers, “as for you, you meant evil against me, but god meant it for good.”. Deep in unfathomable mines of never failing skill, he treasures up his bright designs; The wheels of his mercy. And may we be encouraged that no matter what this life throws at us, god has his ways.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title god acts in mysterious ways quotes by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
