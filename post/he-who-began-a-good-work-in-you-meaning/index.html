Even a simple “thank you” at work goes a long way. Dear god, help me to find encouragement in your word. Philippians 1:6 nkj “being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ:” regardless of how you may feel, no matter what your circumstances may be this morning! Perhaps this promise has encouraged you to press on in the christian life, maturing and becoming more like jesus day by day.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/06/cf/0506cf1fb764c26c105ef24ff1c2072c.jpg alt="Pin On Daily Inspirational Quotes" title="Pin On Daily Inspirational Quotes" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
