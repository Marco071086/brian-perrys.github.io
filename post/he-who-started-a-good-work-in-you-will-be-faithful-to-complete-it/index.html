Paul�s confidence in their perseverance is the belief that it was god�s grace which began the good work in them, and that, not being resisted (as was obvious by their enthusiasm for good), he would complete what he had begun. Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of christ jesus. Regardless of what i do.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/92/61/3e926175c825de2c6eac87811f27cc42.jpg alt="He Who Began A Good Work In You Will Be Faithful To Complete It Philippians 16 Faith Scripture Inspirational Bible Quotes Bible Inspiration" title="He Who Began A Good Work In You Will Be Faithful To Complete It Philippians 16 Faith Scripture Inspirational Bible Quotes Bible Inspiration" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Paul writes in philippians 1:6, “being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of christ jesus.” #2 “that he who began a good work in you…”. Until the day of jesus christ.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title he who started a good work in you will be faithful to complete it by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
