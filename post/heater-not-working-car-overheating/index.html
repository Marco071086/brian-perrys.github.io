After the engine has cooled down (a couple of hours) check the radiator and overflow and top off as required. As you may know, the heater core is a small radiator like unit that circulates the hot coolant from the engine through the heater core which then uses this warm coolant to heat the inside. The amount of coolant in the system is too low. No power, coolant loss, overheating, is sign of headgasket leak.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/36/c1/de/36c1dea0d6500279e7e4991f8a4fc7db.jpg alt="Fix Radiator Leak With These Simple Steps Radiator Leak Radiators Leaks" title="Fix Radiator Leak With These Simple Steps Radiator Leak Radiators Leaks" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

More than likely the air vent door for the heat is not working. The heater not working in some cases may be related to the overheating problem you are also having. Moving forward, keep an eye on the radiator and overflow levels and top off as required and if you spot a weeping hose connection or similar fix that problem.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title heater not working car overheating by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
