One of the most common (and inconvenient) problems with the jeep wrangler is when it has no heat coming from the heater. I�d start by waiting until the jeep is cool (very important) and then removing the radiator cap and checking the coolant level. Look for the simplest things first. If your jeep wrangler’s heater has stopped working, this process has failed in one way or another.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b4/ce/e4/b4cee43b072372ab2697aa43c930d5de.jpg alt="Jeep Wrangler 2001 Replace Heater Vacuum Switch Jeep Wrangler Jeep Jeep Tj" title="Jeep Wrangler 2001 Replace Heater Vacuum Switch Jeep Wrangler Jeep Jeep Tj" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Then we did something to one of the vac lines and it works a little bit now. Several months ago, position 3 for fan speed stopped working. I have a 2016 jeep wrangler.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d8/67/94/d86794205b9554fc2a1c2662d7e1f8af--jeep-wrangler-jk-jeep-jk.jpg alt="Jeep Wrangler Jk Ac Heating Parts Jeep Wrangler Jk Jeep Wrangler Jeep Jk Parts" title="Jeep Wrangler Jk Ac Heating Parts Jeep Wrangler Jk Jeep Wrangler Jeep Jk Parts" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The driver side heated seat indicator button turns off after 5 seconds and does not work.
