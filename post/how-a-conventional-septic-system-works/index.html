Conventional or anaerobic septic systems are the most common type of system installed at residential and commercial properties in the united states. These systems work anaerobically, meaning there is little to no oxygen present in the tank. They break down waste, leaving water clean enough to safely percolate down into the earth. The conveyance line works by gravity to move wastewater away from a home and into the septic tank.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/38/69/79/38697987877622a2806e2307374e079f--septic-system-septic-tank.jpg alt="Photograph Of A Conventional Septic System Layout Septic System Septic Care Septic System Repair" title="Photograph Of A Conventional Septic System Layout Septic System Septic Care Septic System Repair" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Septic tanks work by allowing waste to separate into three layers: The solids settle to the bottom, where microorganisms decompose them. They break down waste, leaving water clean enough to safely percolate down into the earth.
