The geothermal heat pumps work by transferring the heat to and from the ground or water. The ground loop uses fluids that are in thermal connection with the ground to exchange heat with the subsurface. Geothermal heat pumps are important because they are highly efficient, good for the environment, and are able to lower operational costs significantly compared to standard heating and cooling systems. Every geothermal heating and cooling systems has three major subsystems or parts: The heat pump and circulating fluid continuously transfer heat.</p><h3 id=geothermal-heat-pumps-work-by-transferring-heat-from-one-place-to-another>Geothermal heat pumps work by transferring heat from one place to another.</h3><p>Two pieces to the geothermal system. The geothermal heat pump extracts heat from the air inside the building and transfers it into the ground heat exchanger. The refrigerant that leaves the heat pump, circulates in a pipe inserted in direct contact with the ground, exchanges heat with it, and returns to the heat pump. In summer, the geothermal heat pump extracts heat from a building and transfers it to the ground for cooling. The difference is that conventional systems gather their heat—and get rid of it—through the outside air.
