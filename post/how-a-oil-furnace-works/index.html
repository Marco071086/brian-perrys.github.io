Oil is burned instead of natural gas, and the resulting hot air is distributed throughout your home via your duct system. In this type of system, oil is sprayed into a combustion chamber at high pressure, propelled by a blower, and ignited by an electric spark. The oil heats the air or water that heats your home, depending on the type of heating system you have. A return duct sucks the air back in to keep the heating cycle going. A pump draws waste oil from the tank and through a filter.</p><h3 id=an-oil-furnace-also-operates-similarly-to-a-gas-furnace-but-instead-of-natural-gas-in-the-combustion-chamber-a-mist-of-oil-sprays-into-the-chamber>An oil furnace also operates similarly to a gas furnace, but instead of natural gas in the combustion chamber, a mist of oil sprays into the chamber.</h3><p>Ignitors can easily become clogged or broken—leaving you without heat. When activated, the oil furnace uses a fuel pump to draw oil from a reserve tank through a filter and into the burner chamber.
