A radon system or radon mitigation system is one that actively removes radon gas from your home, usually by removing the gas from below the building and expelling it above and away from the building. Correctly installed radon mitigation systems remove the radon gas from under the foundation of a structure before it. The installation of a radon mitigation system would usually need a certified radon mitigation professional. Radon systems installed through the attic space will hide the radon system from view and offer better protection from the freezing and thaw cycle outdoors. Radon mitigation systems use a fan to continuously pull air from the soil and exhaust it outdoors through a pipe.</p><h3 id=the-system-is-installed-to-pull-radon-gas-from-below-the-house-before-it-can-make-its-way-inside>The system is installed to pull radon gas from below the house before it can make its way inside.</h3><p>Correctly installed radon mitigation systems remove the radon gas from under the foundation of a structure before it.
