How a water softener works depends on whether it removes minerals or changes the structure of minerals. This involves exchanging calcium and magnesium ions for sodium ions. In these systems, hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) are exchanged for salt (sodium or potassium) ions. Find out in this video!

How a water softener system works. Ion exchange works by forcing the water to flow through plastic resin beads negatively charged with sodium ion. How a water softener works depends on whether it removes minerals or changes the structure of minerals.
