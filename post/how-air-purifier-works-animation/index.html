In simple words, the air around us is sucked and passed through the filters that are present in the purifier device, trapping all the pollutants, which allows clean. Most air purifiers work when it comes to combining these two filters by placing the first hepa filter and then activated charcoal filter directly behind it. The main kinds include hepa filter, activated carbon filters, and the ion air purifier.
