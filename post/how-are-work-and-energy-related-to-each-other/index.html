To get both moving at a speed of 30 m/s requires the same amount of work.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/08/d7/a1/08d7a131e0d45b761caef91094b39425.jpg alt="Imp Know Picture And Explanation How To Memorize Things Equations Potential Energy" title="Imp Know Picture And Explanation How To Memorize Things Equations Potential Energy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>A book on the floor has zero potential energy. Energy is the ability to perform work. To get both moving at a speed of 30 m/s requires the same amount of work. The standard unit used to measure energy and work done in physics is the joule, which has the symbol j. Power p is the time.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how are work and energy related to each other by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
