As braces put pressure on teeth, the periodontal membrane under the gums shifts as well, either stretching or contracting. How do braces move teeth? Traditional braces orthodontists move teeth through the use of specialized orthodontic hardware, which permits the application of steady pressure over time to move the teeth into their ideal positions.</p><h3 id=only-some-force-not-normally-present-is-needed-to-make-these-small-movements-over-time>Only some force, not normally present, is needed to make these small movements over time.</h3><p>Over time, this combination of brackets and wire can move the teeth.

Traditional metal braces are a highly effective orthodontic option, and involve the use of brackets, wires, and elastic bands. Brackets hold wires in place that apply the constant pressure in the direction the orthodontist wants your teeth to go.
