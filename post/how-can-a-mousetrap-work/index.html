The law of conservation of energy says that the total energy of a system remains constant, energy can not be created and/or destroyed but can be changed to one form and another. Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents. This project results in a simple mousetrap car. The mousetrap can not be physically altered except for the following:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/c2/28/17c2287b5e08f0018d4d79eda3323be5.jpg alt="Myo Water Trap For Mice The Ultimate Bucket Mouse Trap Mouse Traps Bucket Mouse Trap Homemade Mouse Traps" title="Myo Water Trap For Mice The Ultimate Bucket Mouse Trap Mouse Traps Bucket Mouse Trap Homemade Mouse Traps" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The two most important parts of a mousetrap car are the body (frame) and engine which will make the car move. You can either dispose of the trap with it, or you can lift the kill bar and just throw the mouse away. How does a mousetrap work?</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/d6/43/f9/d643f926c6d2741cc2d2f79198e6c2f9.jpg alt="Idea Mouse Traphow To Make Home Made Mouse Trap Work Easy Saving 8 Mice In Few Minute - Youtube Mousetrap Idea Mouse Traphow To Make Home Made Mouse Bricolage" title="Idea Mouse Traphow To Make Home Made Mouse Trap Work Easy Saving 8 Mice In Few Minute - Youtube Mousetrap Idea Mouse Traphow To Make Home Made Mouse Bricolage" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

You power it by simply setting the trap and let it loose by springing the trap. Ok, so it has to be a very small car, but that doesn�t diminish in any way the coolness of the fact it needs neither batteries nor fuel. Learn all about energy and how it applies to mousetrap powered vehicles. The smaller the coefficient of friction, the more efficient your mousetrap car and the greater the travel distance will be.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4c/69/d4/4c69d41355e96a8b3df8832fba7e9762.jpg alt="Ive Tried Making Copies Of Other Peoples Traps Some Are Too Complicated And Mouse Traps Mouse Trap Diy Rat Traps" title="Ive Tried Making Copies Of Other Peoples Traps Some Are Too Complicated And Mouse Traps Mouse Trap Diy Rat Traps" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Snap traps are placed along pathways rodents travel, and an attractant such as food or nesting material can be used. 4 holes can be drilled only to mount the mousetrap to the frame and a mousetrap�s spring can be removed only to adjust the length of the its lever arm. You can either dispose of the trap with it, or you can lift the kill bar and just throw the mouse away.
