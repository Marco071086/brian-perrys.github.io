Some older vehicles (made before 1975) have a front brake limiting valve and a control in the cab. The potential energy of an air brake system is from compressed air. Air brakes are used in large heavy vehicles, particularly those having multiple trailers which must be linked into the brake system, such as trucks, buses.
