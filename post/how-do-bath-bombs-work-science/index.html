It�s so easy to run a bath and just chuck one in, sit back and wait for the glorious smells and colours to take over. Many bath bombs contain citric acid, as found in citrus fruits, and sodium bicarbonate, which is a weak base. Cornstarch has long starch molecules that break apart in water and trap some of the water molecules. The fizziness of bath bombs comes from the chemical reactions that happen when the baking soda and citric acid come into contact with water,.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UT1qWPeY5mA/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Pin On Science 5th Grade" title="Pin On Science 5th Grade" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
