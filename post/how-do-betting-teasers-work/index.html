How teasers and point spreads work. When betting nfl teasers, the most common football teaser varieties are selecting two or three teams and teasing nfl lines by 6, 6.5 or 7 points. You effectively buy points in exchange for pairing at least two bets together. Only bet cards with 2 or more selections can be teased. In the nfl, the key to a good teaser bet is to ensure that your bet crosses many key numbers.</p><h3 id=check-your-bet-slip-and-select-the-parlay-option-on-the-top>Check your bet slip and select the parlay option on the top.</h3><p>Place at least two (and up to 8) bets either against the point spread or on the total points. Since most games are decided by those key numbers if we can tease them down to fall within that range, it increases our chances to win a teaser bet substantially. For positive odds, divide the positive number by 100, and then add 1. Two of the biggest nfl key numbers are three and seven. For negative odds, divide 100 by the negative number, and then add 1. A teaser is not a straight bet, but is more similar to a parlay, but comes with much different odds and odds of winning.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://oddsassist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NFL-Teaser-Example.jpg alt="Teaser Betting Guide What They Are How To Place Them Best Strategies Odds Assist" title="Teaser Betting Guide What They Are How To Place Them Best Strategies Odds Assist" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
