The front brake lever applies more pressure on the front brake if used along with the rear pedal. Let off the throttle, and the engine helps you scrub some speed. Most motorcycle brakes activate the two wheels independently, employing a lever on the right side of the handlebar to operate the front brake and a foot pedal on the right side for the rear brake. A combined braking system (cbs), also called linked braking system (lbs), is a system for linking front and rear brakes on a motorcycle or scooter.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://www.bennetts.co.uk/-/media/bikesocial/2018-august-images/how-it-works-brakes/3.ashx?h=444&amp;amp;w=740&amp;amp;la=en&amp;amp;hash=5C3E7952ABCA64E574C26B422828F6E8FA67464A" alt="How It Works Brakes" title="How It Works Brakes" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
