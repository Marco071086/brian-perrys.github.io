However, there is a split second delay between wherein the trailer load pushes. Surge brakes…or sometimes referred to as “inertia brakes”, are controlled by the push and pull of the vehicle. This quick segment explains how a boat’s trailer brakes work and why they are completely separate from the vehicle. They are loosely fastened to the brake backing plate with their friction surfaces facing away from each other to form almost a full circle.

When a trailer is designed to carry 3,000 pounds, it must have a working braking system. This engages the master cylinder that creates pressure in the brake lines by the use of fluid and puts pressure on the trailer drums or rotors depending on the trailer. Electric trailer brakes, on the other hand, work by activating electromagnetic brake drums to create attrition and therefore slow the trailer down.
