The main purpose of the car air conditioner is to make the cabin ambiance comfortable for the occupants. Learn what is central air, & how it works. An ac system works by cycling refrigerant, converting it from a gas into a liquid, and then back again. They blow air over the cold liquid which cools the room.

An air conditioner (ac) in a room or a car works by collecting hot air from a given space, processing it within itself with the help of a refrigerant and a bunch of coils and then releasing cool air into the same space where the hot air had originally been collected. As the refrigerant changes states, it absorbs heat and humidity from the vehicle and allows the system to give off cool, dry air. The compressed liquid refrigerant has to pass through certain tubes located in. As the name suggests, it “compresses” the refrigerant so that it turns from a gaseous state into a liquid state.
