Manufactured by bayer, the dog collar uses two active ingredients that work in combination with each other to deliver protection against both fleas and ticks for up to 8 months. Unlike many flea and tick prevention products which only kill pests after they�ve first bitten your pet, the seresto collar works on contact, both killing and repelling fleas and ticks.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how do flea collars work seresto by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
