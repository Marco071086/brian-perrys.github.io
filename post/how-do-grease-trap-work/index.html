When wastewater enters a grease trap, the flow rate is reduced enough so the wastewater is given enough time to cool and separate into 3 layers. A grease trap is a plumbing device designed to intercept most greases and solids before they enter a wastewater disposal system. A grease trap works by cooling warm or hot greasy water. Grease traps have an outlet pipe and an inlet pipe separated by one or more baffle walls.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/56/a6/5d/56a65d5773957cf45bd493e296b8a46b--sewer-system-to-remove.jpg alt="How A Commercial Grease Trap Works - Commercial_grease_traps Are Designed To Remove Excessive Amounts Of Oil From Wastewater Sewer System Grease Man Projects" title="How A Commercial Grease Trap Works - Commercial_grease_traps Are Designed To Remove Excessive Amounts Of Oil From Wastewater Sewer System Grease Man Projects" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

How does a grease trap work? Grease traps rely on the fact that fats, oils, and grease (called fog in industry terms) are all less dense than water, meaning that they will float on top. There are many different types of grease traps and interceptors and may work in slightly different ways, but the end result is always the same.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/6b/da/56/6bda56ac43b79ca77566727c23a7eadc.jpg alt="Typical Grease Trap These Are Essential For Restaurants And Large Guest Houses And Hotels Etc Depending On The Size Of The Kitchen And The Space Available We" title="Typical Grease Trap These Are Essential For Restaurants And Large Guest Houses And Hotels Etc Depending On The Size Of The Kitchen And The Space Available We" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>By allowing the fat, grease and oil (fog) to cool, a grease trap is able to separate the different layers of wastes with water. The basic principle behind the working of a grease trap is the difference in viscosity of grease and water along with the rate of flow of the contaminated water. Grease traps collect solids as well. All the waste collected from the restaurant drains are deposited into the first, or primary tank of the trap. The traps wastewater reservoir cools down the grease to room temperature and these substances subsequently harden.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how do grease trap work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
