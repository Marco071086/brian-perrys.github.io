Science tell us that hot air rises, and as the air is heated inside the balloon it causes it to rise upwards (because it is lighter than the cooler air on the outside). The balloon has a fixed volume, so the extra volume flows out of the hole in the bottom of the balloon. When gas in the balloon is allowed to cool down, hot air volume of gas decreases. Usually in examples of boyle�s law, our teachers mention hot air balloon, that the size of balloon increases as pressure decreases.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://letstalkscience.ca/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/2020-01/hot_air_balloon_burner.jpg?itok=Q6wdXnBc" alt="Charles Law And Gay-lussacs Law Lets Talk Science" title="Charles Law And Gay-lussacs Law Lets Talk Science" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If gas expands when it is heated, a given weight of hot air occupies a larger volume then the same weight of cold. So when the air inside the balloon expands, it becomes less dense and provides the lift for the hot air balloon. So here we have the answer to your initial question “how do hot air balloons work?” how hot air balloons work is thanks to the hot air inside the balloon, produced by the burner. The boyle�s law states that the volume of a balloon will expand if the pressure decreases. The ideal gas law states that the pressure times the volume is equal to the number of molecules times the gas constant ( r ) times the temperature.</p><h3 id=as-the-air-continues-to-heat-up-it-expands-according-to-charles039-law->As the air continues to heat up, it expands, according to charles� law :</h3><p>The hot air balloon operates on the principle of charles�s law, which states that the volume of a gas increases with temperature.

Jacques charles, a french physicist, discovered in the 1780s that heating a gas will cause it to expand by a certain fraction. And, with the expanding volume, the density decreases. But the buoyancy of a balloon depends roughly on the density of the gas inside the balloon, so the first step in solving this is to convert the ideal gas law into a form that uses density: Same thing happens inside of a hot air balloon.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://slideplayer.com/5713149/18/images/slide_1.jpg alt="Hot Air Balloons 3-how-hot-air-balloons-work-videohtm - Ppt Download" title="Hot Air Balloons 3-how-hot-air-balloons-work-videohtm - Ppt Download" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: slideplayer.com</p><p>When liquid propane is heated, it turns into a gas. But the buoyancy of a balloon depends roughly on the density of the gas inside the balloon, so the first step in solving this is to convert the ideal gas law into a form that uses density: The boyle�s law states that the volume of a balloon will expand if the pressure decreases. There are four laws, known as gas laws, which describe how gases behave. Now clearly we have a problem here because if a balloon rises it will not expand then shrink, or stay in the same volume.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://0701.static.prezi.com/preview/v2/j22c7dwbifgkgyakrzs25vipg36jc3sachvcdoaizecfr3dnitcq_3_0.png alt="Gas Laws Hot Air Balloons By Jonathan Dauterman On Prezi Next" title="Gas Laws Hot Air Balloons By Jonathan Dauterman On Prezi Next" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

As the air in the balloon is heated by a small flame, the balloon expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding cool air. The law that explains how hot air balloons work is the charles�s law. Usually in examples of boyle�s law, our teachers mention hot air balloon, that the size of balloon increases as pressure decreases.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://faculty.cord.edu/manning/physics215/studentpages/balloon2.jpg alt=Hotair title=Hotair onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The balloon has a fixed volume, so the extra volume flows out of the hole in the bottom of the balloon. So when the air inside the balloon expands, it becomes less dense and provides the lift for the hot air balloon.
