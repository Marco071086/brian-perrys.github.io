What is a hot air balloon?a hot air balloon is a very simple type of aircraft that you can use to fly from one place to another. Anyone who has ever had a bedroom on the second floor of a building during a heatwave can attest to that fact. Therefore, in order for a hot air balloon to work, fire is used to heat the air inside of the balloon so that it is warmer than the cold air outside of the balloon.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/23/04/22/23042240b98bfb560c310c170b0c26c3.jpg alt="Hot Air Ballooning Hot Air Balloon Air Balloon Hot Air" title="Hot Air Ballooning Hot Air Balloon Air Balloon Hot Air" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
