Because the balloon has vents some the particles escape making the inside of the balloon less dense than the air outside of it if you notice this is charles’ law. When the balloon is heated it already is filled with air, but the heat makes the particles speed up and take up more space; The burner mixes the fuel with air and ignites the mixture, which creates a flame directly underneath the bottom opening of the hot air balloon. Essentially, hot air is lighter than cool air, because it has less mass per unit of volume. As the flame burns, the metal in the tubing is heated up and the propane flowing through it is changed from a liquid to a gas.</p><h3 id=1-a-hot-air-balloon-stays-on-the-ground-or-descends-when-the-air-inside-it-is-too-cool>1) a hot air balloon stays on the ground (or descends) when the air inside it is too cool.</h3><p>A cubic foot of air weighs roughly 28 grams (about an ounce). A team of individuals are needed to lay the enormous balloon made of reinforced nylon, a light but strong material, flat on the ground. The hotter it is outside, the hotter i have to heat the balloon to make it fly. Hot air balloons are based on a very basic scientific principle: A hot air balloon uses a burner to heat up the air inside the balloon. The basis of how the balloon works is that warmer air rises in cooler air.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://flatearth.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gravity-balloon.jpg alt="Hot Air Balloon And The Force Of Gravity Flatearthws" title="Hot Air Balloon And The Force Of Gravity Flatearthws" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
