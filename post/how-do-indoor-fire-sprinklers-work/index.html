Similar to a faucet, fire sprinkler systems contain a series of pipes that contain pressurized water. This hot air rises and spreads high along with the ceiling or in some building high on sidewalls. Their purpose is to protect your home from fires that begin within your property, like kitchen fires, electrical fires, etc. When you turn off the water to your home, you simultaneously turn off your fire sprinklers.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://kinetixfire.com/wp-content/uploads/Types-of-Fire-Sprinklers-1.png alt="Types Of Fire Sprinkler Systems And Their Applications Kinetix Fire" title="Types Of Fire Sprinkler Systems And Their Applications Kinetix Fire" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
