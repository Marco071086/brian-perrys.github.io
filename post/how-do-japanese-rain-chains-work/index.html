Their purpose is largely decorative, to make a water feature out of the transport of rainwater from the guttering downwards to a drain or to a storage container. Rain chains (kusari doi) are decorative downpipes originally developed in japan. If the size doesn’t suit you, custom sizes are available upon request.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/80/c5/00/80c5003d50f5c7a6b1f305c19596c118.jpg alt="Ileftmyheartintokyo Rain Chain Modern Rain Chains Japanese Rain Chain" title="Ileftmyheartintokyo Rain Chain Modern Rain Chains Japanese Rain Chain" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When it rains, the japanese sometimes place a ceramic or stoneware pot underneath the chain that is loaded with water. Replacing your downspout with an elegant rain chain will make a huge difference in your curb appeal. The japanese have been using them for centuries to channel rainwater downwards, collect it, and reuse it. The cups on this chain are not as large as some of the cups on the other rain chains that we have looked at in this guide, but they work well with most rains.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how do japanese rain chains work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
