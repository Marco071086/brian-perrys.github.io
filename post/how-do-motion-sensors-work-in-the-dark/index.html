Microwave sensors detect motion using doppler radar and are similar to a radar speed gun. A bona fide motion sensor, like this one from philips hue, uses ultrasonic sound to detect movement, allowing it to still function in the dark. Motion sensor lights add a sense of safety and security to any property. As tomorw is my practical nd i hve made this circuit nd it is now working bt i dont know how it is working….
