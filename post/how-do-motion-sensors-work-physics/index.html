Motion sensor lights react to movement.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.vernier.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/product.md-btd._hero.001.jpg alt="Motion Detector - Vernier" title="Motion Detector - Vernier" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

How microwave sensors work as the name implies, microwave sensors uses continuous waves of microwave radiation to detect motion, similar to how a radar speed gun works. A motion sensor is frequently incorporated as a component of a system that routinely performs a task or else alert a user of motion in a region. Motion sensors are found everywhere today. This sensor provides data about motion, using which the device can alert the user of motion in the area or perform certain tasks.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://cdn2.webdamdb.com/md_9ELiRH1M3f13.png?1565279871 alt="Pasport Motion Sensor - Ps-2103 - Products Pasco" title="Pasport Motion Sensor - Ps-2103 - Products Pasco" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Active sensors and passive sensors. It sends out high radio frequency and measures the reflection off an object by sensing for a frequency shift.
