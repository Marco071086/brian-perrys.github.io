Each key fob is programmed to match a particular door or set of doors, which provides an additional level of security. A proximity key is different from a key fob because a key fob must be waved in front of the reader to allow access, whereas the proximity key can remain in a bag or pocket to unlock the door. You use it to gain entry into a particular building or restricted area without having to use a key.
