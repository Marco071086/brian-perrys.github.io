When you make a call or send a message on a sat phone, it sends a signal to one of the multiple small satellites currently orbiting the earth. This satellite then transmits the signal to the recipient of your message, who can then reply in kind. Satellite phones work by connecting you through satellites positioned in low or high earth orbit.

The difference between the satellite phone and mobile roaming is a lower cost of international calls, free of charge incoming calls and sms regardless of network, as well as unlimited coverage. Other land use for satellite phones include ships at sea, rigs at sea, back up for hospitals, military and recreation.
