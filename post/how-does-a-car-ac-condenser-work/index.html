I make reference to the pressure inside the system which is really important f. A condenser is located in front of the engine radiator and cools the refrigerant from the compressor before it heads to the evaporator located inside the vehicle. As a result, the condenser, which functions to remove heat from the air conditioner machine can’t implement its work properly, making the air conditioner system broken.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b6/47/2c/b6472c66c4310493473ad9c41416969f.jpg alt="Unique Car Ac Wiring Diagram Pdf Thermostat Wiring Ac Wiring Electrical Diagram" title="Unique Car Ac Wiring Diagram Pdf Thermostat Wiring Ac Wiring Electrical Diagram" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The condenser is basically a radiator, and it serves the same purpose as the one in your car: The condenser works as a heat exchanger, and during the conversion state, a tremendous amount of heat is forced out of the refrigerant. The car a/c works in two cycles: A condenser is a heat exchanging device in which substances condense.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/15/b1/a515b1222e60a09786f3f6ef450bc741.gif alt="Pin On Auto Ac Repair Guide" title="Pin On Auto Ac Repair Guide" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The main purpose of the car air conditioner is to make the cabin ambiance comfortable for the occupants. It is a device used in car air conditioning system to expand the high pressure, low temperature liquid refrigerant sent by the condenser in order to release pressure of the refrigerant before sending it to evaporator for the further process. The a/c system is a closed loop filled with refrigerant (typically r134) under pressure.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a car ac condenser work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
