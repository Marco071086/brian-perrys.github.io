Check valves are usually used at the discharge site to help maintain pressure. They use a disk and rubber or leather flapper attached at one side of the opening. The check valve on the well pressure tank is installed to allow the pressurized bladder to work by keeping the bladder from pushing the water back down to the pump in. I have several shallow wells(app 50ft deep), all have check valves just below the pump only and screen on the bottom of the well pipe.

The strainer prevents picking up large debris that could clog or jam the foot valve in its open position (or that might damage the water pump itself). Depending on the type of pressure tank, it could be indicating a higher psi, but if your tank is showing pressure, then your problem is likely within your house and not a problem with the well pump or well. The check valve on the well pressure tank is installed to allow the pressurized bladder to work by keeping the bladder from pushing the water back down to the pump in a submersible pump (most popular) type system. Check valves for well pumps:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/81/a7/6b81a7bde67d3b622cac920d42055429.jpg alt="Well Pump Repair Well Pump Submersible Well Pump" title="Well Pump Repair Well Pump Submersible Well Pump" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The pump (speed, impeller diameter, power) must be designed so the pump can overcome the energy needed to fully open the check valve. The check valve on the well pressure tank is installed to allow the pressurized bladder to work by keeping the bladder from pushing the water back down to the pump in a submersible pump (most popular) type system. Your next check, if needed, is your pressure tank. The flapper type check & foot valves work using gravity.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/83/08/37/83083750ca5d3e5722bd1f91de0bf677.jpg alt="Pin On House Plans" title="Pin On House Plans" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The pump (speed, impeller diameter, power) must be designed so the pump can overcome the energy needed to fully open the check valve. This is a type of check valve because it only allows flow in one direction. Look at the pressure gauge and see if it’s showing a reading above 20 psi.

Source: pinterest.com</p><p>This is a type of check valve because it only allows flow in one direction. At some point, this will reduce the pressure in the pressure switch, causing the pump to cycle back on to increase the pressure. The check valve on the well pressure tank is installed to allow the pressurized bladder to work by keeping the bladder from pushing the water back down to the pump in. It is recommended that at least one check be installed in all submersible well pump installations. They use a disk and rubber or leather flapper attached at one side of the opening.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d0/ce/85/d0ce85b42fc0856eb27f4c01e6f754b4.jpg alt="Ram Pump Ram Pump Pumps Alternative Energy" title="Ram Pump Ram Pump Pumps Alternative Energy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Check valves are usually used at the discharge site to help maintain pressure. They use a disk and rubber or leather flapper attached at one side of the opening. This is called intermittent pump cycling.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a check valve work on a well pump by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
