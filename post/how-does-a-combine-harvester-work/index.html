This modern harvester machine revolutionized the way of harvesting of grain crops. Harvest at the correct time (20−25% moisture content or when 80% of the grains are straw colored and at least 20% of the grains at the panicle base have reached hard dough stage). Before we put in this year’s rice crop and way before harvest 2018, i want to open up the harvester and show you inside.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/66/8b/f1/668bf1506bc5c5276ab6ed62ff3c33ed.png alt="Pin On Crafts" title="Pin On Crafts" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I hope you find it interesting learning how a harvester works and how combines are made. The time interval for harvesting by combine harvester is often narrow: Combine header is one of the most important components of the combine harvesters, being attached at the front of the machine and performing the function of grain collecting. They run by themselves with an engine attached above.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/9b/6e/409b6e2bd7c9ecfc719f2aaf29f6379d.gif alt="403 Permission Denied Toy Car Type Posters Farm Equipment" title="403 Permission Denied Toy Car Type Posters Farm Equipment" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
