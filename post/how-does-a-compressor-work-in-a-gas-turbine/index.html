Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Centrifugal compressor is a machine in which a particular gas or vapor is compressed by a radial acceleration by an impeller with the help of a surrounding case. A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine that has an upstream rotating compressor coupled to a downstream turbine, and a combustion chamber in between. Compressor performance has a large influence on total engine performance. Think of it like an open balloon: Hot gas spins turbine blades:</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a compressor work in a gas turbine by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
