The increase in pressure through the compressor stages is roughly compensated for by the decrease in cross section, so the velocity is roughly constant as you suggest. Jet engines typically consist of compressor and turbine elements and, in the case of turbofan engines, an additional first stage fan element. The heat can reach upto 2700 c. Compressed air,high pressure, flows toward low pressure 2.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2a/19/d9/2a19d9c7849cbb421dc393bdcee7461d.png alt="Turbine Stator Blade Cooling And Aircraft Engines Comsol Blog Jet Engine Jet Turbine Aircraft Engine" title="Turbine Stator Blade Cooling And Aircraft Engines Comsol Blog Jet Engine Jet Turbine Aircraft Engine" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
