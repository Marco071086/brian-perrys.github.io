It will obstruct the normal gas/combustion flow of products.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/26/b2/ce26b28e323251e3f9cc14bc7b0cb74e.png alt="Learn About High-efficiency Condensing Furnaces High Efficiency Gas Furnace House Heating Gas Furnace" title="Learn About High-efficiency Condensing Furnaces High Efficiency Gas Furnace House Heating Gas Furnace" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
