The air when comes in the contact with the hot water, it takes the latent heat of the water and makes it cool. The fan induces hot moist air out the discharge. Also after taking the heat from the hot water, the temperature of the air increases and it makes some of the water evaporate and it further cools the water to lower.

Consider the cooling tower on top of a typical office type building. Airflow exiting the cooling tower is low velocity, so it can be prone to recirculating back into the tower, reducing the tower’s.
