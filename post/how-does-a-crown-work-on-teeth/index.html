When crowns are placed in one’s mouth, they take the place of missing teeth, allowing them to perform their everyday functions once again without issue, e.g., eating or talking. Fitting a crown requires at least two visits to the dentist�s office. When a tooth needs to be restored, a dental crown is often the best solution. When a tooth�s surface breaks, chips, or fractures, an artificial dental crown is placed to prevent further damage.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/49/e1/54/49e154a4a5591425d3af5a292a62a263.jpg alt="Pin On Salud Y Belleza" title="Pin On Salud Y Belleza" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The dentist then makes and fits a temporary or transitional crown made out of plastic or metal. The crown encases the damaged tooth, making it look and work like the original. The dental crown is cemented into place on your tooth and it.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/56/7b/68/567b6875a9db48585aa92ad23d53a030.jpg alt="E-max Crowns Before And After Pictures Case N2 On The Left Side Of The Picture The Patient Before Had 2 Porcel Max Crown Teeth Aesthetic Aesthetic Dentistry" title="E-max Crowns Before And After Pictures Case N2 On The Left Side Of The Picture The Patient Before Had 2 Porcel Max Crown Teeth Aesthetic Aesthetic Dentistry" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
