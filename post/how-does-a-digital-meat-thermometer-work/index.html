Digital meat thermometers, unlike others, are able to give you an almost immediate reading to know whether or not your meat is done. Insert the food probe into your meat before you start cooking. It measures heat energy and converts it into a number that can be read easily in the form of degrees. If you find yourself still hating your meat thermometer like me, try the poke test method.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4a/83/87/4a8387d597bc41bbeb2a9f560d14bf1d.png alt="Amazoncom Senbitertop Meat Thermometer Waterproof Instant Read Kitchen Thermometer Cooking Thermom Kitchen Thermometer Cooking Thermometer Bbq Grill Smoker" title="Amazoncom Senbitertop Meat Thermometer Waterproof Instant Read Kitchen Thermometer Cooking Thermom Kitchen Thermometer Cooking Thermometer Bbq Grill Smoker" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
