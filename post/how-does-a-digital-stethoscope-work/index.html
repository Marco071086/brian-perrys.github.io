Source: researchgate.net</p><p>3m™ littmann® electronic stethoscopes model 3100 and model 3200 are a bit more complicated to use than a mechanical littmann stethoscope. An electronic stethoscope (or stethophone) overcomes the low sound levels by electronically amplifying body sounds. They used headphones and shown the sound recording with rhythm on the screen. Electronic stethoscopes work on the same principle as simple acoustic stethoscopes; A digital stethoscope records clear sounds via a patient’s clothes, while they are also effective for listening to korotkoff sounds heard during the measurement of manual blood pressure.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcel-Mlynczak/publication/260668963/figure/fig1/AS:392412225654784@1470569773140/Schematic-diagram-of-the-digital-stethoscope-system_Q320.jpg alt="Schematic Diagram Of The Digital Stethoscope System Download Scientific Diagram" title="Schematic Diagram Of The Digital Stethoscope System Download Scientific Diagram" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

These sounds are transferred from the stethoscope to the medical professional’s ears to enable proper diagnosis of a patient’s condition or illness. In laymen’s terms, it works by vibrating sound to the physician�s ears and amplifying that sound. The interactive stethoscope is the first digital stethoscope of its kind that provides a remote healthcare practitioner with live stethoscope sounds and the added functionality to adjust the audio frequency range and volume from their remote site. The electronic stethoscopes are also called digital stethoscope.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.maximintegrated.com/content/dam/images/design/tech-docs/4694/4694Fig01.gif alt="Introduction To Digital Stethoscopes And Electrical Component Selection Criteria" title="Introduction To Digital Stethoscopes And Electrical Component Selection Criteria" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The working of these units can be done by sensing sound through the sensor in the electronic stethoscope, converts that sound to electricity and runs through the circuit. Why do doctors listen to.
