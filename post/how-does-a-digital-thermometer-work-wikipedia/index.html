It can measure the temperature of a solid such as food, a liquid such as water, or a gas such as air. That’s because you have to wait for the mercury to heat up first and then slowly rise to display the temperature. ­in this article, we will look at the different thermometer technologies used today and understand how they work. The way a digital thermometer works depends upon its type of sensor.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.qualitylogoproducts.com/thermometers/digital-thermometer-q75233-hq.jpg alt="Digital Thermometer Definition Wikipedia Free Shipping Available" title="Digital Thermometer Definition Wikipedia Free Shipping Available" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: ubaksymposium.org</p><p>A thermometer is an instrument that measures temperature. A digital solid state thermometer provides an excitation current to the sensor and measures the linear (mv/°) signal from the sensor. The thermometer in the refrigerator lets it keep a set temperature (cold). A digital thermometer uses thermistor resistance that varies with temperature. The temperature is measured using the probe (sensing end) and displayed as a digital reading.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/1024_Pyrometer-8445.jpg/400px-1024_Pyrometer-8445.jpg alt="Thermometer - Wikiwand" title="Thermometer - Wikiwand" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
