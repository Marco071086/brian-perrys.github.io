A typical household septic tank is made up of two round tanks made of concrete with lids next to each other. This reduces the quantity of solids and also changes its composition to sludge, which builds up in the bottom of the tank. With the drain field, the sewage from septic tanks is channeled into underground trenches made of flat gravel or stone.
