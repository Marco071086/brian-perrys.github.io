With ductless units the dense refrigerant is pumped to the evaporator which is placed close to the ceiling and since colder air is more dense than hot air, the cold air will naturally drop allowing the air conditioner to utilize its maximum cooling capacity. A ductless system consists of two major components; There are three simple components: This allows the heat pump to extract ambient heat from the outside environment, and transport that heat inside the house.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/da/8d/49/da8d49e12b8b7e540e7a4fbbc8c75ec9.jpg alt="Httpwwwmodularhomepartsandaccessoriescommodularhomeairconditionerunitsphp Has Some Information On T Air Conditioner Heat Pump System Ductless Mini Split" title="Httpwwwmodularhomepartsandaccessoriescommodularhomeairconditionerunitsphp Has Some Information On T Air Conditioner Heat Pump System Ductless Mini Split" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
