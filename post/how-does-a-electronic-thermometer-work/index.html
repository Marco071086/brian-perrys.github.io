How do digital thermometers work? A digital thermometer is used to verify a smart temperature transmitter under flowing conditions and a successful calibration of the smart temperature transmitter. An infrared thermometer works by detecting the temperature of a particular object on account of the thermal radiation which is emitted from that object.
