Co2 gas has a temperature of minus 66c. This requires that you use a fire extinguisher specifically designed to extinguish a specific type of fire. This pin will release the lock and allow you to discharge the extinguishing agent. The co2 displaces the oxygen at the surface of the fire, effectively smothering the fire.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a fire extinguisher work and how should it be used by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
