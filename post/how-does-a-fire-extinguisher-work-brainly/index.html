The co2 extinguisher cannisters contain carbon dioxide in liquid form, and when the extinguisher is let off the liquid is released into the air neutralising the oxygen that the fire is feeding on, disabling the fires ability to spread. It also allows foam fire extinguishers to put out flammable liquid fires, by creating a barrier between the liquid�s surface and the flames. What happens to the nozzle of a co2 fire extinguisher? The oxygen comes from the air.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a fire extinguisher work brainly by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
