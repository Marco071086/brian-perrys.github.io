The p50 fire extinguisher uses an aramid fibre kevlarâ type material to create a super strong and lightweight extinguisher. The first role chemistry plays in a fire extinguisher is when you pull the lever to fire the foam onto a fire you release carbon dioxide which then replaces all of the foam within the bottle. A fire requires oxygen (o 2), fuel, and heat to burn. A water extinguisher can put out things like burning wood, paper or cardboard, but it does not work well on electrical fires or fires involving inflammable liquids.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mechnical-Foam.png alt="Different Types Of Fire Extinguishers Used On Ships" title="Different Types Of Fire Extinguishers Used On Ships" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When you pull the safety pin and squeeze the lever, the lever pushes on an actuating rod that presses the valve down to open a passage to. Even so, several different companies are marketing such hfcs as chf 3. As it ‘pours’ out of the bottle, it pushes the lighter oxygen away from the candle. This is made possible by the wet chemical fire extinguishing agent (potassium) present in the wet chemical fire extinguisher.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a fire extinguisher work chemistry by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
