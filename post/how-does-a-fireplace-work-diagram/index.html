As the warm air rises, cooler air from the room flows into the firebox, fanning the fire, creating more heat in an ongoing cycle. This is called a “draught” and it forces air into the fireplace, this air feeds the flames as it rushes past the fire. Your fireplace creates a column of heated gas inside of the chimney and as the air rises, more heated air is pulled from the fire after it. Some fireplace units incorporate a blower, which transfers more of the fireplace�s heat to the air via convection, resulting in a more evenly heated space and a lower heating load.fireplace efficiency can also be increased with the use of a fireplace fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/eb/c2/f6ebc26f616fab6c9135b6ee2c8c2870.jpg alt="011600201 Chimney Detail Masonry Chimney Design Chimney Cap" title="011600201 Chimney Detail Masonry Chimney Design Chimney Cap" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
