How do foam fire extinguishers work? Afff fire extinguishers is a foam concentrate product which, when sprayed on a flammable liquid fire, forms a thin aqueous film at the fuel/air starving the fuel from the oxygen and suppressing the combustion reaction. These are concentrated foam solution, water and inert nitrogen, which pressurises the extinguisher. Once the foam spray hits the air, it covers the fire.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Chemical-Foam.png alt="Different Types Of Fire Extinguishers Used On Ships" title="Different Types Of Fire Extinguishers Used On Ships" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Dry chemical extinguishers are tanks of foam or dry powder with compressed nitrogen as the propellant.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a foam fire extinguisher work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
