Refrigerators use the principles of pressure, condensing and evaporation of a fluid in a closed circuit to remove heat and reduce the temperature inside the fridge. This gas then passes through heat exchanging pipes where it loses most of its heat to its surroundings which causes the cooling of the refrigerant. The refrigeration cycle explains to us what is happening to the ac freon in each of the four components within the central air conditioner. You probably know that when you put water on your skin it makes you feel cool.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f1/a7/77/f1a7779bf8e30943608b4d25d23fb6e9.jpg alt="Domestic Refrigerator Wiring Electrical Wiring Diagram Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Electrical Diagram" title="Domestic Refrigerator Wiring Electrical Wiring Diagram Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Electrical Diagram" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
