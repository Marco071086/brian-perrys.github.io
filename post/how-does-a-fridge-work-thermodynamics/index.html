Between any two equilibrium states, the change in internal energy is equal to the difference of the heat transfer into the system and work done by the system. The internal energy (and temperature) of the refrigerant is alternately raised and lowered by the devices in the loop. The main purpose of refrigeration is thermal conditioning (e.g.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://engineeringinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gc6.15.f.17-1.gif alt="How Refrigerator Works - Engineering Insider" title="How Refrigerator Works - Engineering Insider" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat will always flow spontaneously from hot to cold, and never the other way around. How all the parts work together. The internal energy (and temperature) of the refrigerant is alternately raised and lowered by the devices in the loop. Typically the thermodynamic system in a refrigerator analysis will be a working fluid, a refrigerant, that circulates around a loop, as shown in figure 3.7.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/d/d8/Refrigerator.png alt="Refrigerator - Energy Education" title="Refrigerator - Energy Education" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This is a law of physics called the second law of thermodynamics. How all the parts work together. (11 of 14) the refrigerator: Figure xi.8 illustrates schematically the path taken by the state of a working substance is a generalized heat engine.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a fridge work thermodynamics by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
