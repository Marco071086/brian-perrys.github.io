From here, the fuel is then ‘distributed’ into each cylinder in the correct amount and at the correct time. The distributor�s main function is to route secondary, or high voltage, current from the ignition coil to the spark plugs in the correct firing order, and for the correct amount of time. The camshaft pump is used to drive the plunger in order to press the fuel. The heat given off by the burner warms the heat exchanger and rewarms the water in the boiler, which holds it in reserve until the circulator pump moves it through the distribution system once again. The power travels down the spark plug wires to the spark plugs and causes sparks.</p><h3 id=distribution-is-the-final-step-in-delivering-natural-gas-to-customers>Distribution is the final step in delivering natural gas to customers.</h3><p>That moves other distributor parts that cause the ignition coil to pulse, and sends the electricity down each spark plug wire in order.

The distributor has a shaft that gets spun by the camshaft. Once the engine is running and when the rpm increases to over 2,000 rpm, the mechanical advance takes over and further increases the advance to 32 degrees.
