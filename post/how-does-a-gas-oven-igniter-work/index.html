The ignition head contains a thin metal rod covered with the plastic casing.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://www.cookerspareparts.com/news/image.axd?picture=/igniter-4.png" alt="Gas Oven Igniter Not Working Replace It" title="Gas Oven Igniter Not Working Replace It" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: cookerspareparts.com</p><p>Electrical current passing through the ignitor operates a small heater that ‘warps’ an internal piece of bimetal to open the gas valve. The hot surface igniter is used in modern gas oven burners to open the gas valve and to ignite the gas. Whenever you turn the oven on, the igniter will open to allow gas to flow directly through the valve. If your oven is running cold, the sugar will not melt. By turning the knobs, the electric current heats an oven’s igniter, opening a valve to allow gas to flow through a burner tube.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/xQxrClvEMSC6Iju7pmOINQYXExuWWxGETgUiasTXzsx_gEe0XXWxU9jx1dFEDWLzJq-ck5oGOdbDWJB_CL9cHCSFvWi26g=s0-d" alt="Gas Oven Igniter Comes On But No Flame - Ovenqta" title="Gas Oven Igniter Comes On But No Flame - Ovenqta" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Once the oven ignitor draws a specific amount of current the oven valve opens to allow gas to flow to the oven burner where the glowing hot ignitor (glow bar) ignites it. In most gas ovens, the igniters are hidden away under a bottom covering. The pilot flame remains lit.
