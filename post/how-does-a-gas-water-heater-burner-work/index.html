Units with a standing pilot also have a thermocouple. Hi, my daughter was gonna wash the dishes but she realized there was no hot water. When you�re having trouble getting the pilot to stay lit, it could be because the thermocouple needs to be replaced.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/d4/04/0fd4048203269cac50760185ca9593d1.gif alt="How To Flush Or Drain A Water Heater Hometips Water Heater Repair Hot Water Heater Hot Water Heater Repair" title="How To Flush Or Drain A Water Heater Hometips Water Heater Repair Hot Water Heater Hot Water Heater Repair" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When the cold water is brought into the tank via a dip tube, this burner heats the water. Steel when the heater uses natural gas and cast iron type when the heater uses propane (lp) gas. If the pilot is out, the thermocouple will not allow gas to flow to the burner.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/52/21/d352213bb6b4bf208d1e08bd5e78dd37.jpg alt="Pin On 1plumbing" title="Pin On 1plumbing" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>With a gas water heater, a gas burner is the heating mechanism. Both are located at the bottom of the tank. When you�re having trouble getting the pilot to stay lit, it could be because the thermocouple needs to be replaced. It does this as cold water is entering into the tank through the dip tube. The gas burner applies heat to the heat exchanger, that the water flows through in the flow through hot water heater, when the gas water heater is working (instant gas geyser is working).</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a gas water heater burner work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
