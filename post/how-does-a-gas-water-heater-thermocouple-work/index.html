When your pilot light is lit, the heat from the flame sends a voltage through the thermocouple that keeps the gas line open. Gas water heaters also have a thermostat, typically a small copper tube with a mercury sensor in the tip. The thermocouple is part of the pilot burner assembly and connects to the gas control valve on the outside of the water heater. This means that if the thermocouple works improperly, there is no solution for identifying if the pilot is burning or not, and you will not have hot water resources in your pumping circuit.

Source: youtube.com</p><p>It is a simple device that converts the heat from a burning flame into a small electrical current, allowing it to work like a switch to control the flow of gas from the gas supply valve. If the thermocouple wasn�t there, and the gas valve stayed open, unburnt gas would collect around the burner assembly and eventually waft into the room, creating a fire and explosion hazard. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple will lose its voltage and the gas line to your furnace will be closed. Once the water heater thermocouple is heated, it sends a signal to the gas control valve which allows the burner to operate, heating the water in the tank. The unburnt gas would accumulate and eventually, it could explode.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0uZDmdpR0E/maxresdefault.jpg alt="How Does A Thermocouple Work In A Water Heater Repair And Replace - Youtube" title="How Does A Thermocouple Work In A Water Heater Repair And Replace - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: youtube.com</p><p>Water heater won’t light or leaking water? What does a thermocouple do in a water heater? The gas control valve allows the pilot to be ignited, and the lit pilot heats the thermocouple. It is a simple device that converts the heat from a burning flame into a small electrical current , allowing it to work like a switch to control the flow of gas from the gas supply valve. A thermocouple is a small device near the bottom of the gas water heaters.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a gas water heater thermocouple work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
