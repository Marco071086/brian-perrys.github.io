Source: climatemaster.com</p><p>How does a geothermal heat pump work. The geothermal heat pumps work by transferring the heat to and from the ground or water. Pipes are buried in the ground (this is known as a ground loop system), and a water solution flows through them. We will focus on air source heat pumps, but the basic operation is the same for both. Just like in a refrigerator, there�s a compressor that effectively squeezes the heat out of the fluid when it�s been pumped inside your home.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a geothermal heat pump work simple by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
