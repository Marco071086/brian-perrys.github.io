Geothermal energy is found in steam and hot water in the earth’s crust. Your geothermal system can generate enough heat for your home’s hot water system as a by product when doing your space conditioning (5). The difference is that conventional systems gather their heat—and get rid of it—through the outside air. Meanwhile, an ordinary heat pump collects heat from frigid winter air, making it least efficient when you need it to be the most.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/57/d7/da57d7e420015460c15ff0ea95680b4a.png alt="Pin By Mark Harring On Pecan Place In 2021 Geothermal Heat Pumps Geothermal Heating Geothermal" title="Pin By Mark Harring On Pecan Place In 2021 Geothermal Heat Pumps Geothermal Heating Geothermal" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
