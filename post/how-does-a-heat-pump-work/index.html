The heat pump works by taking heat from the surrounding air/water/soil and using it to heat low pressure liquid refrigerant in the heat pump’s evaporator, vaporizing the liquid. During colder months, heat from outdoor air is extracted and transferred to the interior of your home. This process is known as space conditioning.
