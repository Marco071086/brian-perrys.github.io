Heat sink is an electronic component or a device of an electronic circuit which disperses heat from other components (mainly from the power transistors) of a circuit into the surrounding medium and cools them for improving their performance, reliability and also avoids the premature failure of the components. It is designed to have the greatest amount of surface area in a small volume of space, so aside from the flat contact surface the heat sink has many thin fins that facilitate heat dissipation through thermal convection, which means the heat is further carried away from the heat sink. A heat sink is a device that incorporates a fan or another mechanism to reduce the temperature of a hardware component (e.g., processor). The heat sink is a thermal conductive material that quickly carries heat away from the processor.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/77/c9/ce77c9fb80fa8d14e824d421e107e7e1.jpg alt="4 Pins 120x120x25mm 12v Heatsink Cpu Cooling Fan Pc Computer Is Available Now From Our Us Warehouse For Only 509 Description 4 Pc Computer Cooling Fan Fan" title="4 Pins 120x120x25mm 12v Heatsink Cpu Cooling Fan Pc Computer Is Available Now From Our Us Warehouse For Only 509 Description 4 Pc Computer Cooling Fan Fan" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Source: pinterest.com</p><p>A heat sink (also commonly spelled heatsink) is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device’s temperature at optimal levels. Numerous methods for attaching heat sinks to electronic components have been developed to dissipate the heat generated by data processing chips during operation. Both a heat sink and a radiator require airflow and, therefore, both have fans built in. Another thing you might notice is, that when you reuse a heat sink on a new pc, you need to reapply the thermal paste, meaning it is dry, so it can’t form to fill the pockets of air between. You can open your computer case to check the status of the heat sink.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a3/42/88/a3428848e898c225349201bdd1e447df--computer-repair-computer-case.jpg alt="Coolchip Technologies Demos Innovative All-aluminum Heatsink-and-fan Cpu Cooler Design Custom Computer Computer Technology Computer Setup" title="Coolchip Technologies Demos Innovative All-aluminum Heatsink-and-fan Cpu Cooler Design Custom Computer Computer Technology Computer Setup" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Heat sinks have the thermal conductors which are used to absorb the excess heat produced by the cpu of a computer. Installing a temporary heat sink will allow the solderer to work without compromising the surrounding circuit board. The cpu heatsink is a large chunk of metal with a ton of fins packed together to increase surface area. You can open your computer case to check the status of the heat sink.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a7/f8/4d/a7f84d434a04eb6dd0359d34f423c342.jpg alt="Cpu Fan For Lenovo Ibm Thinkpad T420i T420 T420s Fan With Heatsink New Genuine T420 Laptop Radiator T420i L Laptop Cooling Fan Computer Components Cooling Fan" title="Cpu Fan For Lenovo Ibm Thinkpad T420i T420 T420s Fan With Heatsink New Genuine T420 Laptop Radiator T420i L Laptop Cooling Fan Computer Components Cooling Fan" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The processors we have in our computers and laptops today are powerful and generate a lot of heat as a result. A heat sink is a component that increases the heat flow away from a hot device.
