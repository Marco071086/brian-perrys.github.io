Hot pressure washers work by using water heated to 200 degrees fahrenheit and a pump which forces the water through a constrictor nozzle. The movement of a plunger or piston in the cylinder draws water through the inlet valve and the upstroke expels it through the outlet valve. Because the water is traveling fast, it hits the dirty surface with high kinetic energy, knocking dirt and dust away like a constant rain of tiny hammer blows.
