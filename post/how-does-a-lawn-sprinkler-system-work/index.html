How do rotating sprinklers work? Each solenoid valve controls the sprinkler heads in a specific zone of your lawn or garden. When the pressure ceases, the heads retreat. When the water pressure stops, they retract back down to ground level. Home irrigation systems, or lawn sprinkler systems, are becoming increasingly popular, and they are especially prevalent in dry climates that do not see ample rain for keeping a lawn green.</p><h3 id=overview-of-sprinkler-system-operation>Overview of sprinkler system operation.</h3><p>Each zone consists of several sprinkler heads controlled by a valve that is electrically activated. Water is released when you activate it. Zones help optimize your system. Once you command the controller, the water passes through and is released to a specific area, and all sprinkler heads will start watering your lawn. The sprinkler heads work on a pressure system that when the water goes through the pipe, it pushes them up above the ground.
