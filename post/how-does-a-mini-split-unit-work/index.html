Positioning the outdoor unit closest to the room you will be cooling will also minimize the required amount of work for installation.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/af/3b/88af3b709b0547b8e39a7d47d59b549b.png alt="Sizing Guide For A Mini Split Air Conditioner Split System Air Conditioner Split System Split Ac Unit" title="Sizing Guide For A Mini Split Air Conditioner Split System Air Conditioner Split System Split Ac Unit" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

One type of air conditioner, the split, works by providing air from a wall mounted cooling unit or vents in the floor (which will be discussed in another post). Unlike a heat pump, however, the indoor air handler is directly installed into the room/zone rather than needing the extra duct work system to transfer the conditioned air into the rooms of your home. You and your loved ones can work from home or sleep soundly free from persistent noises from the system. Warm indoor air gets sucked into the unit.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/df/f6/2e/dff62e2bd31d50d96d2e5c1fcac5cc66--air-conditioning-system-refrigeration-and-air-conditioning.jpg alt="System Evacuating Charging Process Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Hvac Air Conditioning Air Conditioner Maintenance" title="System Evacuating Charging Process Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Hvac Air Conditioning Air Conditioner Maintenance" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
