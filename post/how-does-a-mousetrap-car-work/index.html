The mechanical advantage can be calculated as follows: A mousetrap car uses the stored energy of a mousetrap spring to generate forward motion. A mousetrap car is a small vehicle whose only source of motive power is a mousetrap.variations include the use of multiple traps, or very big rat traps, for added power. How the mousetrap car functions might appear very simple to people somewhat mechanically inclined but many people who see one of my mousetrap cars often ask, “how does this work”?</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/94/50/f3/9450f35d3afaa3b97b0eb157fab21883.jpg alt="How To Build A Mouse Trap Car Introduction Toy Cars Can Be A Lot Of Fun To Build But Most Of Them Involve The Use Of S Mousetrap Car Mouse Trap" title="How To Build A Mouse Trap Car Introduction Toy Cars Can Be A Lot Of Fun To Build But Most Of Them Involve The Use Of S Mousetrap Car Mouse Trap" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When the squid is released, it pulls the rope, which in turn turns the shaft, turns the wheel and causes the vehicle to move. By winding the string around the axle the mousetrap�s spring is stretched providing stored energy. These cares are most frequently used for science class experiments. When a mousetrap is set, the spring in the center is compressed, becoming a source full of potential energy.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1c/66/62/1c6662e8b78a526c19cbcb40e74c7617.jpg alt="Mousetrap Car Mousetrap Car Car Toy Car" title="Mousetrap Car Mousetrap Car Car Toy Car" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The two most important parts of a mousetrap car are the body (frame) and engine which will make the car move. Simply put, they convert the energy of the mousetrap�s spring into rotational energy that gets delivered to one set of wheels. When the energy stored in the mousetrap spring is released, the lever arm is moved to convert the potential energy into kinetic energy.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ce/c4/c9/cec4c9c307a3d9e689df1a1de0a2c582.jpg alt="Mouse Trap Cars - Distance-time Graphs Speed-time Graphs Editable Mousetrap Car Mouse Traps Distance Time Graphs" title="Mouse Trap Cars - Distance-time Graphs Speed-time Graphs Editable Mousetrap Car Mouse Traps Distance Time Graphs" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
