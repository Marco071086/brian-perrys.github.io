In this manner, inverter generators preserve energy while still producing clean energy that can be used to power all types of home electronics. An inverter generator works differently. The alternating current (ac) power produced by the alternator is sent to a rectifier, which is a device that converts the ac power to direct current (dc). An inverter generator is your best bet if you need a portable option, but inverter generators can’t beat the sheer power production capability of a regular generator. These small petrol generators produce a smooth power output which makes them perfectly safe to use with sensitive electronic appliances, ideal for powering items such as heaters, televisions, laptops, lights and more.</p><h3 id=when-comparing-inverter-generator-vs-regular-generator-the-inverter-generator-consumes-less-fuel-produces-less-noise-and-comes-in-a-smaller-and-more-portable-size>When comparing inverter generator vs regular generator, the inverter generator consumes less fuel, produces less noise, and comes in a smaller and more portable size.</h3><p>This whole phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction.
