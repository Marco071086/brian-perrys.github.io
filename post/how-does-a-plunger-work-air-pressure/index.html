When you press the plunger down, it forces air into the drain and increases the atmospheric pressure on it. When you then pull back up on the plunger, the vacuum created will force anything inside the tube to.

Plungers work via physics, specifically boyle’s law. The air pressure from outside the syringe is too great compared to. This volume is reduced to approximately.5 ml when the plunger is depressed yielding a compression ratio of 18:1, thus when the plunger is depressed the unit compresses the air inside the cylinder 18 times its normal pressure.
