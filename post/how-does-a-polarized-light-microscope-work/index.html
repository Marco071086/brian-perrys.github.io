Polarized light microscopy is a useful method to generate contrast in birefringent specimens and to determine qualitative and quantitative aspects of crystallographic axes present in various materials. This polarized light falls on a doubly refracting specimen which generates two wave components that are at right angles to each other. The third type of lens called the condenser lens focuses the light rays, and then the objective lens and eyepiece magnify the specimen. Presented in figure 1 is a rectified universal polarizing microscope designed by shinya inoué, gordon w.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a polarized light microscope work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
