In a prenuptial agreement, you and your spouse disclose to each other all the money and property you own before getting married.

So you can set out in your prenup that neither party has any estate law obligations to the other, which would mean that you can dispose of your assets by will and beneficiary designation as you choose. For starters, a prenup (officially known as a prenuptial agreement) is a legal document that couples get before they get married that determines the division of property in case the marriage ends in divorce.
