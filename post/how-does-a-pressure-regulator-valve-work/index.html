The principle of operation of the pressure reducing valve. Whether it is within medical equipment where the regulation of oxygen and other gases are required or within pneumatic actuation systems where they regulate compressed air, the function of pressure regulators is pretty much the same. From the diagram shown above, when you apply pressure to the top of the regulator, a spring pushes the diaphragm down and reduces the amount of excess fuel. In layman’s terms, it maintains the set pressure and allows the excess pressure to vent through the regulator.
