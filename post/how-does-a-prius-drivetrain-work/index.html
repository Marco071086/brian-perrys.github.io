The electric motor is attached to a ring gear , which transfers the power of the motor to a reduction gear unit that�s connected to the final drive. The prius can launch from a standstill at respectable acceleration up to about 10 m.p.h. The prius has a power split device, which includes a gearbox connecting the generator, gas engine, and electric motor. Only about a fifth of the torque comes directly through the mechanical path during this initial acceleration.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a prius drivetrain work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
