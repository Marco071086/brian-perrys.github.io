If your prius doesn’t have any heat or has codes p1121, p1120, p1122 or p1123, the likely cause of both your lack of heat and the check engine light/check hybrid system message is a stuck coolant flow control valve. While there are a variety of reasons your toyota prius heater is not working, the most common 3 are a broken heater blower motor, a problem with the thermostat, or a failed heater blower motor resistor. In winter, this is achieved by keeping the internal combustion engine (ice) on less often, forcing the fan speed to be lowered to reduce the. I think the small electric ptc heaters are also on the 2004 prius, like they were on the classic prius (in countries that need the cold weather package, like the us and canada) they provide a little bit of heat when you first start your car.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/47/90/09479067c88f122211a1431ff37bb74e.png alt="Pin On Wwwccarpricecom" title="Pin On Wwwccarpricecom" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The prius c is a simpler reach, and you can lean into the engine compartment and insert the heater. The electric motor is attached to a ring gear , which transfers the power of the motor to a reduction gear unit that�s connected to the final drive. There are three high current relays and three 30 amps fuses for the heaters and they are located in the under hood fuse block on the passenger side (north american layout) near the fire wall.
