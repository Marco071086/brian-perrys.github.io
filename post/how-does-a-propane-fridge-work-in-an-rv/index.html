Most of the time a propane rv refrigerator work after a chemical reaction occurs between three different elements. Once the rv is taken to a place with electricity, the camper can then turn off their propane and run the fridge off of shore power. Rv refrigerators will not work without a battery because batteries power the control board and facilitate ignition.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a5/f8/df/a5f8dfa8bc1d8fac2217412469f8db83.jpg alt="How Does An Rv Refrigerator Work Using Absorption Rv Repair Club Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Rv Repair Rv Refrigerator" title="How Does An Rv Refrigerator Work Using Absorption Rv Repair Club Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Rv Repair Rv Refrigerator" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The propane option in your fridge works like this: The fridge’s control panel requires around 12v of dc (direct current) to open a gas valve and 10.5v is needed for the igniter to start working. The propane fridge has an ignitor that turns the combustible gas into a flame. The front panel leds and thermostat are also powered.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/236x/58/b2/c8/58b2c84b0dd352ba871bf938bfc66ab9.jpg alt="Getting To Know Your Rv Important Rv Refrigerator Tips Before You Hit The Road Rv Refrigerator Refrigerator Camper Fridge" title="Getting To Know Your Rv Important Rv Refrigerator Tips Before You Hit The Road Rv Refrigerator Refrigerator Camper Fridge" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The propane fridge has an ignitor that turns the combustible gas into a flame. The ammonia is heated then goes through an evaporation and condensation process which causes the cooling effect of the fridge. An rv fridge rated at 1500 btus per hour could run for roughly 61 hours off 1 gallon of propane. The control board needs a 12 volt dc battery to control the gas valve.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/61/8a/a9/618aa99050f57408c2c5d32c6ef9a78e.jpg alt="Smad 12v 36qt 3-way Lp Gas Absorption Refrigerator Truck Rv Mini Fridge Chalet Propane Refrigerators Refrigerator Sale Mini Fridge" title="Smad 12v 36qt 3-way Lp Gas Absorption Refrigerator Truck Rv Mini Fridge Chalet Propane Refrigerators Refrigerator Sale Mini Fridge" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
