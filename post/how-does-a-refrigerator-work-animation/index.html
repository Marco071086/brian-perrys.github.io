Refrigerators and freezers (as well as air conditioners, heat pumps, and other appliances that produce “cold”) use basic refrigeration principles to extract heat from the air. Inside a refrigerator (1), we change a liquid into a gas to pick up heat from inside the cooling cabinet (2), pump it outside the machine, and then change it back into a liquid to release its heat there (3).

To cool the refrigerator, a working substance, or coolant, such as freon is required.the refrigerator works by a cycle of compressing and expanding the freon, combined with phase transitions between the gaseous and liquid phases of freon. In the refrigerator, the heat that is generated is transferred to the outside of the refrigerator. So the gas again needs to be changed to the liquid state.

This process, called evaporation, cools the surrounding area and produces the desired effect. The refrigerant gas condenses into liquid at high pressure. The refrigeration system is designed so that the refrigerant will evaporate in the evaporator at a temperature that�s about 10° to 15° below the temperature setting if it�s a refrigerator or freezer, and the temperature will drop to around 0° in the evaporator of an. Refrigerators and freezers (as well as air conditioners, heat pumps, and other appliances that produce “cold”) use basic refrigeration principles to extract heat from the air.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/71/e8/c8/71e8c8df7fc526856f2215fe2b3a7971.jpg alt="Refrigeration Cycle Hvac Maintenance Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Power Engineering" title="Refrigeration Cycle Hvac Maintenance Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Power Engineering" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

In this case it is moving the refrigerant round in a loop or circuit. When the hot gas in the coils meets the cooler air temperature of the kitchen, it becomes a liquid.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a refrigerator work animation by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
