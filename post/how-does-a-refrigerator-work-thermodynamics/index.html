The second law of thermodynamics states that if a cold object is placed next to a hot object, the cold object will become warmer and the hot object will become cooler. January 8, 2015 refrigeration admin. The coils on the back of the refrigerator let the hot refrigerant gas dissipate its heat.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6f/b7/fa/6fb7fa0428e2b3d3965bac54ddb35078.jpg alt="Carnot Cycle Thermodynamics Internal Energy Brayton Cycle" title="Carnot Cycle Thermodynamics Internal Energy Brayton Cycle" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It is not a violation of second law of thermodynamics, because the heat is ejected to surrounding air and total entropy of (refrigerator + surrounding) is always increased. The evaporation valves are present inside the fridge thus when the cold liquid enters these valves, the warmness present in the refrigerator will be absorbed by the cold liquid. This is because according to the second law of thermodynamics, heat always flows to cold body from a hot body so whatever food product you place in refrigerator, the warmness present in the. There are four parts (expansion valve, compressor, evaporator, condenser) and all are connected with copper or steel tubes.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/85/d0/0585d098f313d085d7d187ab4237e5c3.jpg alt="Introduction To The Thermodynamics Of Materials Ebook Rental Thermodynamics Download Books Ebook" title="Introduction To The Thermodynamics Of Materials Ebook Rental Thermodynamics Download Books Ebook" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

A refrigerator is a device which maintains a body at a temperature lower than the temperature of the surroundings.let the body has to be maintained at temperature t�,which is lower than the ambient temperature t.eveb though body is insulated,there will always be heat leakage q� into the body from the surroundings by the virtue of temperature difference.now in order to maintain.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0586/1828/2159/t/14/assets/pf-ca094cbd--HowdoesaRefrigeratorwork2_500x.jpg?v=1627210040" alt=How-does-a-refrigerator-work title=How-does-a-refrigerator-work onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
