This hydraulic pressure, in a hydraulic brake booster system, is then stored in an area called an “accumulator.” when you push on your brakes, the pressure is taken from the accumulator to the vehicle’s master cylinder via the hydraulic booster system, effectively stopping the car. A brake controller can be roughly split in an interface, positioned in the cab within the driver’s reach, and a main part, responsible for activating the brakes of the trailer.
