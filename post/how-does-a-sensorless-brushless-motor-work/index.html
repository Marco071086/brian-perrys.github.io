Sensored motors have a separate sensor, and an additional five wires, that tells the controller which direction and how fast the motor is turning. Its a brushless esc for brushless motors both sensored and sensorless and it will also do brushed motors and the manufacturer specs the esc when used with a brushed motor to be limitless and can use any brushed motors. Brushless dc motors use permanent magnets similar to motors, but are constructed “from back to front.” magnets are fixed to the rotor, and the stator is wound around a specified number of poles.

Source: m.youtube.com</p><p>In a brushless dc motor (bldc), you put the permanent magnets on the rotor and you move the electromagnets to the stator. The magnets are attached to the motor’s bell and push and pull the motor as necessary. The process for this involves us working with the specific motor you have and testing it extensively in (as close to) the actual operating conditions as possible. (esc) the speed control must know the position of the rotor in order to accelerate the motor from zero rpm smoothly.
