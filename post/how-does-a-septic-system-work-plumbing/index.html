The tank digests organic materials and separates solids, oils, and grease from the wastewater. (some of these networks of pipes even date back to 70s and 80s) this waste then reaches and gets collected in. The septic tank is a watertight box, usually made of concrete or fiberglass, with an inlet and outlet pipe. Regular ‘pumping’ removes sludge and scum from the tank, helping to keep a septic system in top shape. They use a combination of nature and proven technology to treat wastewater from household plumbing produced by bathrooms, kitchen drains, and laundry.</p><h3 id=this-partly-treated-liquid-then-flows-into-perforated-pipes-called-the-leaching-bed-where-it-filters-into-the-ground-and-is-further-treated>This partly treated liquid then flows into perforated pipes, called the leaching bed, where it filters into the ground and is further treated.</h3><p>How does a septic system work?
