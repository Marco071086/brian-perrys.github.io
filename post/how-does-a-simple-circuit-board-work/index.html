It is a board that has lines and pads that connect various points together.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/d8/6a/0dd86a517095d0c01c8d0a8db72f074b.jpg alt="1pc Audio Speaker Protection Boards Assembled Stereo Loud Speaker Circuit Board Dual Channel Relay Pcb Circuit Module 12-15v In 2021 Circuit Board Audio Speakers Relay" title="1pc Audio Speaker Protection Boards Assembled Stereo Loud Speaker Circuit Board Dual Channel Relay Pcb Circuit Module 12-15v In 2021 Circuit Board Audio Speakers Relay" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When the switch is off, a complete circuit will not exist, and there will be no current. These layers are connected by conductive strips known as traces. Apply the third long piece to make a square, but don�t press the tape down yet.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IuG2vuwdMXc/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Printed Circuit Board Design Beginner Step By Step Circuit Board Design Printed Circuit Board Circuit Board" title="Printed Circuit Board Design Beginner Step By Step Circuit Board Design Printed Circuit Board Circuit Board" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Simply speaking, a circuit board is a printed board that has electrically conductive pathways called ‘traces’ that connects electronic components to each other. The first thing to understand about a circuit board is that it comprises different layers.
