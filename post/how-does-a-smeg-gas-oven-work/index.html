Open the oven door (this will be the main oven door on the double ovens), the smeg label is on the left hand side, as shown in the picture. Right hand side of oven.

Requiring you to spray a small mixture of water and detergent into the oven, the lower element will work with vapour clean to clean the oven. It works by heating the inside of the oven up to 500°c, at which temperature any grease or food residue is simply burned off. If your one won�t reset, try pulling the buttons out, cleaning them and refitting.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.vieffetrade.eu/shop/foto_articoli/Smeg/503290/503290.jpg alt="Smeg B71gmxi9 Classica - Opera Striking Kitchen Cm 70 X 60 - Stainless Steel 1 Electric Oven 5 Gas Burners Vieffetrade" title="Smeg B71gmxi9 Classica - Opera Striking Kitchen Cm 70 X 60 - Stainless Steel 1 Electric Oven 5 Gas Burners Vieffetrade" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I�ve been using a free standing smeg for about 10 years now and it�s been problem free. All you need to do is hold the 2 buttons as in the video and it will clear. Once the oven has slightly passed the target temperature the thermostat closes the valve allowing the oven to cool. Upper and lower heating elements.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.wakefords.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Untitled-design-2021-07-08T145029.284.png alt="Smeg 90cm Concert Gas Electric Cooker - Stainless Steel Ssa91max9 - Wakefords Home Store" title="Smeg 90cm Concert Gas Electric Cooker - Stainless Steel Ssa91max9 - Wakefords Home Store" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
