A side benefit is that this raised intake may breathe air with less dust in it than an air intake closer to the road. The valve closes automatically and normal breathing is possible again. How does a snorkel work? The snorkel is a definite advantage as per what jma said, my landcruiser is a fuel injected petrol with a factory fitted snorkel & keeps the air filter nice & clean in the dusty environment we have in summer here, 8km dirt road in & out every time it�s driven, plus more dirt roads when we take our horse float out into the bush for off the beaten track rides.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ac/cd/5c/accd5cd2247c126f4a312248eea65af7.jpg alt="Telawei 4x4 Snorkel Kits For Toyota 80 Series Landcruiser Lexus Lx450 4500 011sat0080a Lexus Lx450 Lexus Snorkeling" title="Telawei 4x4 Snorkel Kits For Toyota 80 Series Landcruiser Lexus Lx450 4500 011sat0080a Lexus Lx450 Lexus Snorkeling" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I see even the snorkel on the amarok on 4x4 safari�s is backwards facing. A simple powerful exhalation opens the valve and pushes the water out of the tube. The way it works is very simple.

Most snorkel tops, or hats as they are commonly called, face forward so when you are driving on the highway, the air is being forced down into your airbox. This is not a big help for modern turbocharged engines but older, naturally aspirated engines can get a performance benefit from the added air pushed in.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/f6/53/4df6531db5224dbe5e54d4fdb80b4e2d.jpg alt="China 4x4 Snorkel Manufacturer-tlv4x4 Has Eight Tips For Putting In A Snorkel Kit On Your Vehiclewading Depthvehicle Structuresqual Snorkeling 4x4 Snorkels" title="China 4x4 Snorkel Manufacturer-tlv4x4 Has Eight Tips For Putting In A Snorkel Kit On Your Vehiclewading Depthvehicle Structuresqual Snorkeling 4x4 Snorkels" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Reputable manufacturers like safari spend a lot of time perfecting snorkel designs so that any gains that can be achieved from increased airflow are taken advantage of. James david said it’s critical to use the best possible materials, regardless of cost.

Source: pinterest.com</p><p>How does a snorkel work? I can understand that prevents bugs and goggas going down the snorkel. The air quality at roof level is cleaner and cooler than air travelling through and around the bonnet, which means greater fuel efficiency and less clogging of air filters when a snorkel is fitted. Then, of course, there is safety and. They’re designed to force air and dust or water through the snorkel system based on the forward motion of the vehicle.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c6/06/2c/c6062c8d72ec1ab76c867f95a2aa60ca.jpg alt="Nissan Pathfinder Mammoth Bfgoodrich Ironman Snorkel Kmc Rg1 Wheels Nissan Pathfinder Pathfinder Nissan" title="Nissan Pathfinder Mammoth Bfgoodrich Ironman Snorkel Kmc Rg1 Wheels Nissan Pathfinder Pathfinder Nissan" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

In more recent times, with the advent of leisure 4wd vehicles, snorkels are mostly fitted to allow the crossing of rivers without causing damage to the engine. In standard vehicles, the air intake for your engine is located under the bonnet.
