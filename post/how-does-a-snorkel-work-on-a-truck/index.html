It is definitely true that a snorkel (as its name implies) will make it possible (with some other engine modifications) for the truck to literally be able to get through deep water, though it may come as a surprise that this is not the only thing a snorkel helps with. Centrifugal force then throws the particles aside where they are collected in the bottom of the bowl.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/58/b6/6b58b63e81075c62d1480c29cffb4397.jpg alt="Safari Snorkel Snorkeling Chevy Avalanche Safari" title="Safari Snorkel Snorkeling Chevy Avalanche Safari" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
