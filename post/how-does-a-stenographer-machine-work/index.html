Today�s keyboards, or qwerty keyboards, are known for being able to type letter for letter with the user. Modern stenographs include two rows of consonant keys on each side, placed underneath a ‘number bar’, and in front are four keys for the vowels a, o, e, and u. The left hand spells out the beginning of a syllable, while the right hand spells out the end; Stenography is used mostly in legal proceedings during court reports.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/de/20/89/de2089fb6c770afcb80ff185dc4c052f.jpg alt="Stenograph Diamante Steno Machine- Free Shipping Court Reporting Court Game Boy Advance Sp" title="Stenograph Diamante Steno Machine- Free Shipping Court Reporting Court Game Boy Advance Sp" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>The first couple months of stenography training is just learning to read/memorize this bizarre language and get a handle on how the machine works. The words are indifferent but the sound is essentially the same. Modern stenographs include two rows of consonant keys on each side, placed underneath a ‘number bar’, and in front are four keys for the vowels a, o, e, and u. Many court reporters use stenograph machines to quickly and accurately record testimony, and the devices are also used by students to take notes, and closed captioners who want to be able to quickly write captions for live broadcasts. Stenographers can type entire words all at once by striking multiple keys at the same time.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/d2/df/1dd2df33743bea619d74d38f73411cee.jpg alt="Vintage Stenographer Typewriter Court Reporting Stenographer Typewriter" title="Vintage Stenographer Typewriter Court Reporting Stenographer Typewriter" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Stenography is used mostly in legal proceedings during court reports. A stenographer is a person who transcribes vocal content using a unique shorthanded style of writing called steno on a steno machine. Stenographers are working alongside speakers when they, for instance, produce live subtitles for television purposes. Words are spelled phonetically and syllables can be typed with a single key or group of keys, allowing very high typing speeds (200 words per minute or more).</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/37/cd/3d37cd5f4d527b9e4f22da1b2b3acb80.gif alt="Language Log Blame Miles Bartholomew Ward Stone Ireland And Ibm Court Reporting Reading Writing Court" title="Language Log Blame Miles Bartholomew Ward Stone Ireland And Ibm Court Reporting Reading Writing Court" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Chords, much like the ones played on a piano, express sounds instead of letters and allow the stenographer to type at a slower rate to achieve the same word count, because those chords can express entire words and phrases. All keys are pressed at the same time, and the machine produces an alphabet soup that�s incomprehensible to anyone who�s not trained in machine shorthand.
