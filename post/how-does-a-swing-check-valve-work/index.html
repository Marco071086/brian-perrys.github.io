When the valve disc is in the open position, a clear flow path is created through the valve. Swing checks — swing check valves are the oldest and most common type of valves. They also let fluid pass through without slowing down the flow much when fully open. Swing check valves are typically full bore with optimized design of body cavity and disk for piggability, including the capability to handle intelligent pigs.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://empoweringpumps.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CheckValve.jpg alt="How Do Check Valves Function And Why Would They Be Selected Over Other Valve Types - Empowering Pumps And Equipment" title="How Do Check Valves Function And Why Would They Be Selected Over Other Valve Types - Empowering Pumps And Equipment" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
