A thermopile is a bunch of series connected thermocouples that generates maybe 800 millivolts and this is also in the pilot flame. The thermopile controls another valve that is in series with a switch type thermostat to turn the main burner on and off to control the temperature output of the device.

A thermocouple is an electrical device that responds to temperature change by a change in voltage output. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple will lose its voltage and the gas line to your furnace will be closed. It does this by sending a tiny electric current to a sensor on the gas valve signaling the valve to stay open.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://cdn3.volusion.com/hkvs7.73qo2/v/vspfiles/photos/35-1040-2.jpg?v-cache=1623748928" alt="Crown Boiler 35-1040 Thermocouple 30 Q309a1988 - Parts4heatingcom" title="Crown Boiler 35-1040 Thermocouple 30 Q309a1988 - Parts4heatingcom" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The basic idea of a thermocouple: It senses when the pilot light is burning hot enough to light the gas from the main gas valve. He was able to prove that if two dissimilar electrical conductors have a temperature differential across them, then a voltage difference is produced. The job of the thermocouple is to keep the pilot lit.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Test-a-Thermocouple-Step-14.jpg/aid9649384-v4-1200px-Test-a-Thermocouple-Step-14.jpg alt="How To Test A Thermocouple 14 Steps With Pictures - Wikihow" title="How To Test A Thermocouple 14 Steps With Pictures - Wikihow" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It does this by sending a tiny electric current to a sensor on the gas valve signaling the valve to stay open. When your pilot light is lit, the heat from the flame sends a voltage through the thermocouple that keeps the gas line open. The thermocouple can do this because, in its probe, it contains two different metals, and a voltage is. In this hvac furnace video, i show you how the combination gas valve receives the voltage to keep the pilot valve open via the thermocouple.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does a thermocouple work in a boiler by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
