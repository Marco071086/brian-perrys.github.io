The thermocouple is in the pilot flame which must be lit for gas to enter and if the flame goes out, this low(20 millivolt) signal goes to zero and the main solenoid valve closes cutting the gas supply off, which is a safety measure. This small amount of voltage is sent to the wall switch. It is used for ensuring safety of the ignition system and preventing fuel leakage. A thermocouple is an intricate safety device for your indoor fireplace. This signal tells the gas valve that the pilot light is lit.</p><h3 id=clean-cloth-s-a-dirty-thermocouple-may-affect-the-ability-of-the-gas-fireplace-to-ignite>Clean cloth (s) a dirty thermocouple may affect the ability of the gas fireplace to ignite.</h3><p>The function of the thermocouple is to send a signal to the gas valve to stay open while the pilot is on.
