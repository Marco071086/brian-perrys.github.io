The thermoelectric effect that makes a thermocouple work is called the seebeck effect, named after the german physicist who discovered it in 1821.

Thus, the thermocouple will turn off the patio heater as it tricks the gas value in to thinking that the pilot light is out. A thermocouple works to produce a small electrical voltage output by connecting two dissimilar metals or two wires forming a measurement junction at the sensor tip of the device.
