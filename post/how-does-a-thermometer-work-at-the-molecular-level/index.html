In this kids educational videos, we are going to see how does a thermometer work?a common thermometer uses mercury in a glass tube. An electronic thermometer works by putting a voltage across its metal probe and measuring how much current flows through it. Your thermometer doesn�t measure energy;</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/38/b2/44/38b244de682e7a3cdb10003d95be164b.png alt="Kseeb Solutions For Class 8 Science Chapter 15 Heat - Kseeb Solutions Science Class 8 Chemical Changes" title="Kseeb Solutions For Class 8 Science Chapter 15 Heat - Kseeb Solutions Science Class 8 Chemical Changes" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Therefore, the new level of mercury does not change. The red liquid is contained in a very thin tube so that a small difference in the volume of the liquid will be noticeable. My students now know that molecules move, based on their investigations with food coloring in a beaker of water, so i now want them to develop an understanding of how a thermometer works.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/67/34/e86734b6185ad4391df8a60eacb21821.jpg alt="Vacation Budget Worksheet Savings Tracker Letter Size Etsy Budgeting Worksheets Budgeting Budget Vacation" title="Vacation Budget Worksheet Savings Tracker Letter Size Etsy Budgeting Worksheets Budgeting Budget Vacation" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules within a substance. When it is hot, the liquid inside the thermometer will expand and rise in the tube. If two junction are at different temperatures (e.g. If you do not know about the zeroth law, then it is nothing but the concept of thermal equilibrium.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does a thermometer work at the molecular level by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
