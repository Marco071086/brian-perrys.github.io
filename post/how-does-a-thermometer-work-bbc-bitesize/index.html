Vapours rise through a column which is hot at the bottom, and cold at the top Fractional distillation works because the different liquids have different boiling points. An alcohol thermometer is a thermometer which utilizes the expansion and contraction of alcohol in response to temperature changes to measure the temperature. Now we have the thermometer conditioning the sensor and making an electrical measurement of its output. A number of different alcohols can be used, depending on the environment where the thermometer is being utilized, with ethanol being among the most common.</p><h3 id=as-a-part-of-a-weather-station-a-thermometer-records-data-relating-to-the-highestlowest-temperature-average-temperature-indooroutdoor-temperature-variations-etc>As a part of a weather station, a thermometer records data relating to the highest/lowest temperature, average temperature, indoor/outdoor temperature variations etc.</h3><p>When a reaction takes place in the calorimeter, the temperature of the water bath changes.
