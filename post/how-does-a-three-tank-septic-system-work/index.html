What is a septic system? Aerators introduce air into sewage treatment systems to mix and oxygenate the liquid, and this system is made up of three chambers that filter. Specifically, this is how a typical conventional septic system works: Once the waste water reaches the level of the outlet pipe in the first chamber, it will overflow into the second chamber.
