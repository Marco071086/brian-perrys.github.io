As you push the brake pedal, a shaft moves through the booster on its way to pushing the piston in the master cylinder. Brake systems that have them are often called “power brakes.” ­ ­the vacuum booster is a metal canister that contains a clever valve and a diaphragm. Another key part of the power brakes is the check valve.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/4e/50/4c/4e504cff91d7e1cf5ad6c498af098428.jpg alt=U5jihmkwqkfxgm title=U5jihmkwqkfxgm onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
