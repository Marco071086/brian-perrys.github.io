[fish tank oxygen air pump] : Filtration pumps found inside fish tanks are a type of submersible pump. Typical aquarium air pumps move air by using an electromagnet to rapidly vibrate a rubber diaphragm. 1)it drives the filter using bubbles to move water through a filter and 2) as the bubbles exit the lift tube and pop at the surface, they disrupt the naturally forming surface film to allow the air unobstructed contact with the water (as required to keep the water oxygenated).
