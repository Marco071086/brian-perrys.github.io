Here’s how a geothermal system works for cooling: The process is reversed during the summer, and heat from the house is transferred through the heat pump into the water solution in the ground pipes, which then carry excess heat into the ground. When operating, a desuperheater is capable of producing hot water with a temperature of 130f+.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c4/0f/9d/c40f9daf871b67ff5bf43b55808cc009.jpg alt="Air Source Heat Pump Diagram - Google Search - Ilppi Ym - Air Diagram Google Heat Ilppi Pump Heat Pump System Geothermal Heat Pumps Geothermal Energy" title="Air Source Heat Pump Diagram - Google Search - Ilppi Ym - Air Diagram Google Heat Ilppi Pump Heat Pump System Geothermal Heat Pumps Geothermal Energy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

In winter, the geothermal heat pump takes natural heat from the ground and transfers it to the home or building for Typically this energy supply source is a buffer tank connected to the indoor side of a geothermal heat pump, or it could be the cooling loop from an industrial process. The warmer water is then pumped back into the water heater. These units are more efficient as they concentrate on the naturally existing ground and water temperatures.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/56/90/75/569075391a63cff291bbe30d604bb9ad.gif alt="Geothermal Heat Pump Ground Source Heat Pump Geothermal Heat Pumps Ground Source Heat Pump Heat Pump Installation" title="Geothermal Heat Pump Ground Source Heat Pump Geothermal Heat Pumps Ground Source Heat Pump Heat Pump Installation" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
