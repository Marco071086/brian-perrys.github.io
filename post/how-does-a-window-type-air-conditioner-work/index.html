When the window ac is started the blower starts immediately and after a few seconds the compressor also starts. This draws room air through the air inlet grille and a filter that removes airborne dust and particles. One type of air conditioner, the split, works by providing air from a wall mounted cooling unit or vents in the floor (which will be discussed in another post). This set point of the thermostat fixed in the split air conditioner is achievable in this step. The air moving inside the room and the front part of the air conditioner where the cooling coil is located is considered to be the cool air.</p><h3 id=if-only-the-outside-could-be-as-comfortable>If only the outside could be as comfortable.</h3><p>To use the window ac as the heat pump in the winters the direction of the flow the refrigerant is changed by.
