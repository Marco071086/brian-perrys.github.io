In the summer, the pump releases the heated air outside. This allows the unit to absorb heat from the outside air, even in low temperatures, and transfer this heat inside your home, where it warms the air. Or simply, the heating cycle heats us in the winter. During summer, this means removing heat from inside a home and exhausting it outdoors.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1c/1e/33/1c1e331ea0d2b0d9f0d03e812b55cd1f.jpg alt="Heat Pump Energy Conservation - 28 Pages Buy Use And Maintain Heat Pumps To Use Less Electricity Heat Pump Heat Pump System Ductless Heat Pump" title="Heat Pump Energy Conservation - 28 Pages Buy Use And Maintain Heat Pumps To Use Less Electricity Heat Pump Heat Pump System Ductless Heat Pump" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
