Refrigerant is pressurized by the air compressor, which senses the temperature in your vehicle and makes desired changes when activated to do so from the center console. A compressor, which is powered by the engine using the serpentine belt and has a low side port that is connected to the evaporator along with a high pressure side port which is connected to the condenser using rubber hoses. Last week, i explained why a guy from massachusetts became so obsessed with having working a/c in his vintage cars and also described why the a/c needs of a vintage car are different from those of a car built after the switch from r12 to r134a refrigerant. It’s time to dive into some nice, cold air.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e6/48/af/e648afeaa6cc68846a34caea46d1183b.jpg alt="Go Look Importantbook Electronic Water Conditioner Ac Amnimarjeslow Al Do Four Do Al One Ljbusaf Th Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Ac System" title="Go Look Importantbook Electronic Water Conditioner Ac Amnimarjeslow Al Do Four Do Al One Ljbusaf Th Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Ac System" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This is due to the rapid expansion of the compressed gas. How does ac work in a car? Think of it like an open balloon: Without the ac compressor, the refrigerant won’t circulate on the ac system, and you will notice your air vent not blowing cold air.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/10/6b/e9106bbd66f2ddb0e15a72f91e45531e.jpg alt="Auto Air Conditioner And Repair Components Automotive Air Conditioning Compressors Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Design Electric Air Compressor" title="Auto Air Conditioner And Repair Components Automotive Air Conditioning Compressors Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Design Electric Air Compressor" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Last week, i explained why a guy from massachusetts became so obsessed with having working a/c in his vintage cars and also described why the a/c needs of a vintage car are different from those of a car built after the switch from r12 to r134a refrigerant. Without the ac compressor, the refrigerant won’t circulate on the ac system, and you will notice your air vent not blowing cold air. If you have ever used a can of compressed air to clean computer components, you will know that the bottle gets very cold in a short amount of time. As the refrigerant changes states, it absorbs heat and humidity from the vehicle and allows the system to give off cool, dry air.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does an ac compressor work in a car by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
