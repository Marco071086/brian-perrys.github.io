For most animals, the optimal voltage range is generally considered to be between 2000 and 6000 volts. Let’s switch it off and if we switch it on again you’ll see it works properly. The energizer display will light with a blue (off), green (all is ok), yellow (alarm in history or other medium priority event) or red (active alarm condition exists) background to announce the energizer’s state at a glance and from a distance. The fenceguard is an innovative way to monitor your electric fences.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.ako-agrar.com/cms-media/media-1316101.jpg alt="Fencecontrol - Ako-agrartechnik" title="Fencecontrol - Ako-agrartechnik" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It can however be operated by means of a nemtek tab or remote switch. For an electric fence shock the current produced by an energizer must complete a full circuit. For most animals, the optimal voltage range is generally considered to be between 2000 and 6000 volts.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://solutionsunlimited.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Electric-Fence-Razor-Wire-Solutions.jpg alt="Electric Fence Solutions In Kenya Solutions Unlimited" title="Electric Fence Solutions In Kenya Solutions Unlimited" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
