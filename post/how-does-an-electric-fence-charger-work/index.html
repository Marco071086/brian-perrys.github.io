When lightning hits your electric fence, the electricity travels to this spot and then shortcuts to the ground by arcing across the arrester.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does an electric fence charger work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
