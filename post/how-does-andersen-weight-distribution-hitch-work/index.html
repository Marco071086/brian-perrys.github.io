One size fits all when sizing you’re the andersen hitch, this means it can be interchanged from one van to the next and can tow up to 3500kg gtm or 350kg ball weight. I am considering an andersen weight distributing hitch to use with a new travel trailer that i am purchasing. A weight distribution hitch, on the other hand, comes handy when the trailer’s tongue weight exceeds the weight limit of the tow vehicle’s receiver hitch. The weight distribution does work with the anderson and my setup but the way that the tail wags the dog on the highway is really tiring.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://thehandycamper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WDJune2019_2_web-e1598017481193.jpg alt="Andersen Weight Distribution Hitch The Handy Camper" title="Andersen Weight Distribution Hitch The Handy Camper" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

One size fits all when sizing you’re the andersen hitch, this means it can be interchanged from one van to the next and can tow up to 3500kg gtm or 350kg ball weight. Andersen has caught up on production and hitches are shipping a few days after ordering! A weight distribution hitch uses leverage on the hitch through tensioned chains or spring bars to “distribute” more weight to the front axle of the tow vehicle. If you have experience with the andersen wdh, i would greatly appreciate your opinion.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2575/0190/products/AndersenHitches-2433_0eb7ed6b-30fd-4729-a2ec-83445ff8b0fd_2048x.jpg?v=1623094466" alt="4 Droprise Weight Distribution Hitch - Andersen Hitches Customer" title="4 Droprise Weight Distribution Hitch - Andersen Hitches Customer" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This unconventional weight distribution hitch is not suitable for some light weight travel trailers. This dramatically helps reduce motion up and down. I am considering an andersen weight distributing hitch to use with a new travel trailer that i am purchasing. A weight distribution hitch is mounted to a rear hitch, but it’s still considered as a separate hitch type.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://www.forestriverforums.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=97518&amp;amp;d=1452378683" alt="Is The Anderson Hitch Good Enough For A Rockwood 8311ws - Page 2 - Forest River Forums" title="Is The Anderson Hitch Good Enough For A Rockwood 8311ws - Page 2 - Forest River Forums" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

We do not carry the andersen weight distribution you mentioned but we do carry several others that use the more traditional spring bar setup as opposed to the chains. It looks like a simple hitch and is much lighter than the hitch i am currently using. The general consensus on the andersen setup is that it�s very quiet compared to others and it does seem to work well but once you get over 500 lbs of tongue weight is just isn�t as a effective as a spring bar type setup.
