We do not recommend placing the bait stations in areas easily accessible by children or pets. A bait station is a small, plastic box with an entrance that allows rats and mice to enter. Bait is passed on to other workers, larvae and queen/s for complete control.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/57/de/d7/57ded7f05c5226e5da005205a30c1284.jpg alt="4pk Ant Bait Station By Central Garden And Pet For More Information Visit Image Link This Is An Affiliate Link Kill Ants Ant Control Diy Pest Control" title="4pk Ant Bait Station By Central Garden And Pet For More Information Visit Image Link This Is An Affiliate Link Kill Ants Ant Control Diy Pest Control" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When no ants visit for several. While the queen may be dead, you still have the rest of the colony to deal with. As long as ants are coming to the bait station, the colony is still at least partly functional and you should keep the bait station stocked with liquid ant bait.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0f/c2/0f/0fc20fc046d730de6e930b17456396b1.jpg alt="Pin On Gimme" title="Pin On Gimme" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

A small ant colony may succumb to terro ant bait in a couple of days, while a colony numbering in the hundreds of thousands may take weeks to collapse. It’s important to place the bait near areas where ants have been observed.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does ant bait station work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
