Source: nbcnews.com</p><p>Remember that worker ants go in and around your home looking for food and water. A good bait is one that doesn’t kill the ants until they have had time to feed on it and carry it back to the colony.

You want to put it as close to the area where you are seeing the ants, but out of the reach of animals and children. Since the poison works slowly, the ants have time to go back and distribute the poison. Basically, you place it in areas where the ants are walking, find the source of their interest, ad interrupt their route with the gel.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does ant bait work reddit by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
