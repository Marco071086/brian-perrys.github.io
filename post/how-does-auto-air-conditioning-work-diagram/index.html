The compressor acts as the pump, causing the refrigerant to flow through the system. At sea level ‐ ‐r‐134a boils at ‐15⁰ f at 30 psig ‐ ‐r‐134a boils at 35⁰ the pressure of thef evaporator will control it’s temperature. It is connected by a electromagnetic clutch witch serve engage and disengage the compressor. This is then circulated along with lubricant oil to the condenser.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zalg5VyPvjk/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Auto Air Conditioning Systems At A Glance - Youtube" title="Auto Air Conditioning Systems At A Glance - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Air conditioners work on the principle that “liquids absorb heat when they become a vapor (evaporate). As the refrigerant changes states, it absorbs heat and humidity from the vehicle and allows the system to give off cool, dry air. This is essentially how air conditioners work. Around 30 per cent of the heat generated during combustion is transferred to the coolant, giving a ready heat source.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/lookaside/crawler/media/?media_id=288441899594959" alt="Jfs Auto - How Your Heater And Air Conditioning Ac Works Without The Heating And Air Conditioning Systems In Todays Modern Vehicles We Would All Be Miserable Driving To Our Destinations We" title="Jfs Auto - How Your Heater And Air Conditioning Ac Works Without The Heating And Air Conditioning Systems In Todays Modern Vehicles We Would All Be Miserable Driving To Our Destinations We" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Air conditioners work on the principle that “liquids absorb heat when they become a vapor (evaporate). As the refrigerant changes states, it absorbs heat and humidity from the vehicle and allows the system to give off cool, dry air.
