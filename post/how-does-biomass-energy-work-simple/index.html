Later, these fuels can be burned for energy generation. The basic process of biomass energy, or bio energy, has to do with photosynthesis.

That�s because plants absorb energy from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. However, biomass must not be directly burnt. Bioenergy can be traced back to energy from sunlight, produced via photosynthesis, making it a major renewable energy source.
