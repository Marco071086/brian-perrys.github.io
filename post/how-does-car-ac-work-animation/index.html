At normal pressure and temperature, refrigerant starts evaporating in the evaporator coil and latent heat of evaporation takes adjacent surface or adjacent areas or surrounding air. Hey, in this animation i explain the basics of how a vehicles ac system works. The compressed air can be used as energy as it’s released. The high pressure liquid instantly transforms to a low pressure gas vapor (35 psi at 32° f or 0° c) which creates the coldness inside the evaporator in which case the blower motor passes air through it and into the ventilation system and into the interior of the car.</p><h3 id=this-is-due-to-the-rapid-expansion-of-the-compressed-gas>This is due to the rapid expansion of the compressed gas.</h3><p>Then, the air is forced through an opening in the tank, where pressure builds up.

They’re powered by an engine that turns electrical energy into kinetic energy. I make reference to the pressure inside the system which is really important f. The compressed air can be used as energy as it’s released. At normal pressure and temperature, refrigerant starts evaporating in the evaporator coil and latent heat of evaporation takes adjacent surface or adjacent areas or surrounding air.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/49/fa/aa49fac17aff04603989748c552298a5.jpg alt="How Car Cooling System Works Car Radiator Car Buying Engineering" title="How Car Cooling System Works Car Radiator Car Buying Engineering" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The first is the air circulation system, which pulls the room’s air and filters impurities, such as dust and dirt as well as moisture. The high pressure liquid instantly transforms to a low pressure gas vapor (35 psi at 32° f or 0° c) which creates the coldness inside the evaporator in which case the blower motor passes air through it and into the ventilation system and into the interior of the car. Whenever you turn on the car ac system, the compressor pumps gaseous or vaporized refrigerant to the condenser. The air conditioning system in your car is comprised of a compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/72/fc/a072fc5a280bece0ed70f64836fcc1d4.gif alt="Refrigeration Cycle Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Thermopompe Hvac" title="Refrigeration Cycle Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Thermopompe Hvac" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Then, the air is forced through an opening in the tank, where pressure builds up. They’re powered by an engine that turns electrical energy into kinetic energy. The compressed air can be used as energy as it’s released.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does car ac work animation by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
