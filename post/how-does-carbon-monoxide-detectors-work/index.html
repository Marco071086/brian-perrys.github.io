In a nutshell, the carbon monoxide detector works by sensing the presence of the compound in the air. As it is odorless, it cannot be detected by the human olfactory system. Most carbon monoxide detectors use one of three (3) possible methods for detecting co gas. If the sensor is activated, it will send an alert to the panel and trigger an instant alarm event.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f0/12/7b/f0127bb92ce6eb8755625838cec87437.gif alt="Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon Monoxide Safety Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon Monoxide" title="Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon Monoxide Safety Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon Monoxide" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Different sensors set off different types of alerts: Carbon monoxide detectors trigger an alarm based on an accumulation of carbon monoxide over time. Two basic types of co detectors. There’s a myth that carbon monoxide alarms should be installed lower on the wall because carbon monoxide is heavier than air.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/a4/f1/3b/a4f13b417e597c958ac460841ff9b893.jpg alt="First Alert Plug-in Wbattery Back-up Electrochemical Carbon Monoxide Detector In 2021 Carbon Monoxide Detector Plugs Detector" title="First Alert Plug-in Wbattery Back-up Electrochemical Carbon Monoxide Detector In 2021 Carbon Monoxide Detector Plugs Detector" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It will go off before you even start sensing symptoms. If you’re asking, “does my carbon monoxide detector still work?,” knowing the type of detector you have is important. Carbon monoxide (co) detectors are made to measure levels of carbon monoxide over time and to sound an alarm when carbon monoxide levels become dangerous to the point where they could potentially cause poisoning.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/a7/b1/1da7b14d2acd09dcd8f885160cf2bf60.jpg alt="First Alertjarden Sc7010bv Hardwired Talking Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Alarm Smoke Alarms Motion Sensor Lights Outdoor Best Waterproof Camera" title="First Alertjarden Sc7010bv Hardwired Talking Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Alarm Smoke Alarms Motion Sensor Lights Outdoor Best Waterproof Camera" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Carbon monoxide alarms are the most effective way to detect carbon monoxide in the air and alert you to the presence of the dangerous gas. When a small voltage is applied between electrodes and carbon monoxide releases an electron and a small current after reacting with oxygen.
