First, a standard hvac system for central heat and air conditioning consists of a system of ducts inside a building’s walls through which air travels to warm or cool the whole building. So when we mention below “ductless cooling,” we also mean ductless heating as well—you get both when you have a ductless mini split installed. A ductless air conditioner is exactly what it sounds like: As the name says it all, a ductless air conditioner works without any help from ducts.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b6/19/7e/b6197e78a86b93ae853e6099e4639e15.jpg alt="Hessaire 12000 Btu 10 Ton 115-volt Ductless Mini Split Air Conditioner W Inverter Heat Pump Remote And 16 Ft Copper Line Set-h12hp1a - The Home Depot Air Conditioner Inverter Ductless Mini Split Heat Pump" title="Hessaire 12000 Btu 10 Ton 115-volt Ductless Mini Split Air Conditioner W Inverter Heat Pump Remote And 16 Ft Copper Line Set-h12hp1a - The Home Depot Air Conditioner Inverter Ductless Mini Split Heat Pump" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This results in cooler air being pushed back into the living space by the internal blower. Heat energy from the indoor air is absorbed by the refrigerant, and the resulting cooler air is pushed into the living area by the internal blower. Ductless air conditioners operate much differently. As the name says it all, a ductless air conditioner works without any help from ducts.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8b/12/db/8b12db69fda134abfd6d4523ae478021.png alt="How To Install A Ductless Air Conditioner Ductless Air Conditioner Diy Air Conditioner Air Conditioner" title="How To Install A Ductless Air Conditioner Ductless Air Conditioner Diy Air Conditioner Air Conditioner" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

With the interior units, you may hear the fan blowing cool air into the room, but it’s not very loud. The components are much like conventional air conditioners. While a traditional ac unit has a central unit that delivers cooled or heated air to the house through ducts, a ductless ac consists of (at minimum) an indoor and outdoor unit connected by refrigerant tubing and electric wiring.

The refrigerant removes heat and humidity from the air inside as it runs through the indoor unit and releases that heat when running through the outdoor unit. You see, ductless acs and central acs produce cool air exactly the same way: By all accounts, the components of a ductless air conditioner are nearly the same.
