The lab will attempt to fertilize several eggs in a laboratory using the recipient’s partner’s sperm or selected donor sperm. Afterwards, the sperm of a father or a donor is examined and used for the fertilization in an embryology laboratory, with the embryo being later transferred into the uterus of a woman (recipient). The procedure of egg donation starts with the fertilization of an egg of a woman selected by a couple as a donor.
