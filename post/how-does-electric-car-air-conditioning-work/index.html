An air conditioner in a room or a car works by absorbing hot air from a particular room, processing it into itself with the help of a refrigerant and a series of coils, and then releasing cool air into the same room where the hot air was originally collected. Now in liquid form, a drier removes impurities before reaching a thermal expansion valve which essentially allows the driver to control the temperature in the car by limiting the liquid flow. The heat pump on your electric car takes warm air generated in the system and pumps it into the cabin to warm you and your passengers.
