Saliva enhances protection of enamel by providing high levels of calcium and phosphate ions at the tooth surface. It can even reverse, or stop, early tooth decay. But fluoride can help even after your teeth are formed.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/f1/86/a2f1868941361d10da08a1b167421805.png alt="Pin On Ap-24" title="Pin On Ap-24" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Then it attacks the enamel on the inside of the tooth. That prevents tooth decay, or cavities. For this reason, many dentists emphasize the importance of fluoride in children.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does fluoride work to prevent cavities by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
