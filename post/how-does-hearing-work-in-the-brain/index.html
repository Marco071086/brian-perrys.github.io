Hearing is the sense by which sound is perceived, allowing a person to identify and recognize objects in the world based on the sound they produce. The primary instrument for sound gathering in the ear is the eardrum, or tympanic membrane, which separates the outer ear from the middle ear. Humans think and experience emotions with their brain, and it is the root of human intelligence. Sound travels from your ears to your brain�s hearing center, where there are two subsystems:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/31/29/2831295d25e372d8df1850029b1bb2f1.jpg alt="Pin On Hearing Aids" title="Pin On Hearing Aids" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
