The frequency response of your eardrum, or the range of frequencies that will cause it to vibrate, determines your hearing range. A whistling sound can be caused by a hearing aid that does not fit or work well or is clogged by earwax or fluid. A hearing aid does not completely separate the sounds you want to hear from the ones you do not want to hear.
