It makes sense that professors would want to see if students were using any materials that would give them an unfair advantage on a test, but it is hard to see how this feature in honorlock helps with that. As a result, it will flag any suspicious activity and alert your instructor instantly. This is presumably so honorlock can see if there is anything or anyone that can possibly help you cheat on a test. Now i’m not sure on the camera part but that would seem like a lot of effort to make someone specifically watch you the whole time.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SNts0B7UV7Sck1bPQwamwC-it_GzedeD-eAyUoPKAjBFY7gvMp274wtob8qUMy_fIFGAfm3Bqq1K_UQDX7aBwrzIpWwk5mVdtGUfz1xeCQxxJelG68MtrnrC9xDroD0QIzeTD6YI alt="Create A Third Party Exam Honorlock Help Center" title="Create A Third Party Exam Honorlock Help Center" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
