Before we take a closer look at how the pick 6 payout works here’s a refresher on the basics of the bet. You can apply the horse betting strategy you already have in mind for higher chances of winning. The wonderful thing about horse racing is that you can make it as easy, or as complex as you�d like to make it. Exotic bets are those which involve more than one race or more than one horse. If you bet on only one combination, your odds are relatively low.</p><h3 id=you-can-apply-the-horse-betting-strategy-you-already-have-in-mind-for-higher-chances-of-winning>You can apply the horse betting strategy you already have in mind for higher chances of winning.</h3><p>In its simplest form, horse racing payouts are dictated by $2 win bets. Your payout is calculated by subtracting the amount of winning dollars from the total pool, then dividing the remaining pool by the amount of cash bet on the winner, and finally adding back in the winning bet amount. Divide that figure by the amount bet on your horse to get the exact odds. That would mean the remaining pool of $1,615 would be divided between the people who bet on that winning horse.
