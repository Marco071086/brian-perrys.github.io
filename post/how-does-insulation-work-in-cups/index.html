Radiation is heat transfer through electromagnetic light waves that we can�t see. The vacuum is there to prevent the heat from escaping and cold from coming in. The air acts as a very good insulator.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fa/6b/4f/fa6b4f0ecb6569c23a42eaf309bc3024.jpg alt="Wholesale Custom Eco Friendly Stainless Steel Led Temperature Display Smart Thermos Vacuum Flask In 2021 Stainless Steel Thermos Weird Kitchen Gadgets Vacuum Flask" title="Wholesale Custom Eco Friendly Stainless Steel Led Temperature Display Smart Thermos Vacuum Flask In 2021 Stainless Steel Thermos Weird Kitchen Gadgets Vacuum Flask" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Conduction is the way heat moves through materials, such as when a spoon placed in a hot cup of coffee conducts heat through its handle to your hand. Vacuum insulation in a thermos is one of the best ways to keep your coffee hot for a long time. Wrap up a cup of really hot water in a material that you think might be an insulator (i.e. In other words, it works by moving heat from a hot liquid to the cooler air by the motion of the air.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/1b/7e/861b7ef7ad102bf2353bcaf277721478.jpg alt="500ml18oz Hot Stainless Steel Vacuum-insulated Thermos Leak-proof Insulated Container Coffee Tea Water Be Coffee Thermos Vacuum Bottle Stainless Steel Thermos" title="500ml18oz Hot Stainless Steel Vacuum-insulated Thermos Leak-proof Insulated Container Coffee Tea Water Be Coffee Thermos Vacuum Bottle Stainless Steel Thermos" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

There’s a vacuum insulated layer between the double walls of the insulated cup, it was made by vacuum technique to eliminate the air to create the vacuum layer, because the heat can not be transfer without air, the vacuum layer can stop heat flow from inside to outside and from outside to inside To eliminate condensation and maintain your beverage’s temperature by not allowing the heat or cold to escape. These components act as a barrier to prevent the heat transfer that takes place through conduction and convection.
