This should make a safe (no hot unshielded suicide plugs), cheaper ($55 vs $100+), easy to use kit to parallel your generator and combine your output. Paralleling generators or running generators in parallel means that simply connect two generators in parallel to double the power output. Increase your portable power by combining two generators together with this firman inverter generator parallel kit. When you are at the jobsite or looking for power on the go, simply connect two ryobi inverter generators together with the ryobi parallel kit to get up to double the.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://photos.imageevent.com/2oldman/boondocking/websize/ParallelSocket.JPG alt="Rvnet Open Roads Forum Diy Parallel Kit For Invertergenerators" title="Rvnet Open Roads Forum Diy Parallel Kit For Invertergenerators" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I am a handyman, not an electrician or electrical engineer. The power from the two generators combines before going. Stacking inverters allows them to act as a single system. The conventional generator produces ac power directly but the inverter generator produces ac power , then converts it to dc power , and then again converts it to ac power for clean power and maximum fuel efficiency.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.championpowerequipment.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/100319-lifestyle-11-556x0-c-default.jpg alt="50-amp Parallel Kit - Champion Power Equipment" title="50-amp Parallel Kit - Champion Power Equipment" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
