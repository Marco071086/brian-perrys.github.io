Poly(dimethylsiloxane) is the substance that silly putty and similar products are made from. But with kinetic sand, the thick, viscous coating’s main role is to help the sand stick together so it can be cut and molded without making a mess. Kinetic sand is made up of 98% sand and 2% silicone oil. A variation of this, kinetic sand, has several of the same properties, but acts like wet sand.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/78/87/6e/78876e20b6b5ddd9fadd7121d592f643.jpg alt="Diy Kinetic Sand Crafty Tube" title="Diy Kinetic Sand Crafty Tube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Kinetic sand is a type of sand coated with silicone oils that allow the sand to both change shape under pressure, but also maintain its structural integrity. Hydrophobic sand is a toy made from sand coated with a hydrophobic compound. It sticks to itself but not to hands and clothes. The key to making this sand work is: The more water in the mix the less similar it will.</p><h3 id=ive-always-been-mesmerized-by-kinetic-sand-and-decided-to-dive-into-the-physics-behind-it-this-week>I’ve always been mesmerized by kinetic sand, and decided to dive into the physics behind it this week.</h3><p>This will most likely encourage your children to explore other ways of playing with the kinetic sand. Kinetic sand is basically ordinary sand that is coated in poly(dimethylsiloxane). Kinetic sand can also be “sliced” into pieces using a knife. The properties of kinetic sand allows it to be shaped into pyramids or other simple shapes and to be cut into shapes with cookie cutters or molds.

Similarly, with kinetic sand, the polymer chains within the silicone oil make the sand particles stick together so you can form them into a ball. Dry the sand out as much as possible. The pocket of air makes magic sand unable to get wet.
