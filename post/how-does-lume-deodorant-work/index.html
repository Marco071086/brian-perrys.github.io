Lume creates a barrier that blocks fluids like sweat, urine, blood, semen, and prevents them from causing body odor. Many of lume’s products are scented, but they are scented naturally. Lume works by destroying the bacteria that leads to body odor without messing up the healthy physiological ph of our skin.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/1d/81/d31d81af74cc4c4a9cbff68f3831f538.png alt="Lumes Doctor-developed Natural Deodorants Are Aluminum Free Hypoallergenic Baking Soda Free And Safe For S In 2021 Natural Deodorant Deodorant Super Sensitive Skin" title="Lumes Doctor-developed Natural Deodorants Are Aluminum Free Hypoallergenic Baking Soda Free And Safe For S In 2021 Natural Deodorant Deodorant Super Sensitive Skin" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
