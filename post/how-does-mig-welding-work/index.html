Metal inert gas (mig) welding is an arc welding process that uses a continuous solid wire electrode heated and fed into the weld pool from a welding gun. This welding process can be used on both thick and thin sheets of metal, as well as aluminum and other nonferrous materials. A gasless mig welder simply uses a flux cored electrode wire.
