These are called mrna vaccines.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/4/2021/01/embedded256905495-660acf7.png?quality=90&amp;amp;resize=940,931" alt="Oxford Covid Vaccine Uk How Effective Is It - Bbc Science Focus Magazine" title="Oxford Covid Vaccine Uk How Effective Is It - Bbc Science Focus Magazine" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
