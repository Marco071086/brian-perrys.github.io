A tag is attached to the object that needs to be identified/tracked. In principle an rfid tag works as follows: Rfid, library security, radio waves, security system, tag, theft detection introduction rfid means radio frequency identification i.e. The 15 most frequently asked questions about rfid 1.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ca/7d/88/ca7d886b3e5ab11c3e723606cdf800b5.jpg alt="Rfid And Keypad Based Door Lock Using Arduino - Hacksterio Arduino Projects Diy Arduino Rfid Arduino" title="Rfid And Keypad Based Door Lock Using Arduino - Hacksterio Arduino Projects Diy Arduino Rfid Arduino" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
