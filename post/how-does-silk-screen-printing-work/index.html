Silkscreen printing is essentially a stenciling technique, where a design is imposed on a screen of silk or other fine mesh, with blank areas coated with an impermeable emulsion. A negative of the image to be printed is then placed over the screen (in the form of an opaque drawing or shape) and the screen is exposed to light. The screen printing process is a technique whereby a design is transferred through a mesh screen, onto a substrate, with fabric ink. Silkscreen prints are usually made with acrylic paint that is mixed with a binder.

Traditionally, this mesh was crafted from silk thread, but nowadays this has been superseded by polyester fabrics, which offer the same performance for a lower price. With the help of these frames layer by layer, the required print is created on the screen. A negative of the image to be printed is then placed over the screen (in the form of an opaque drawing or shape) and the screen is exposed to light.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/36/0f/16/360f163206a96d6f1948e0406fddf584--screen-printing-process-silk-screen-printing.jpg alt="Polyesterscreenprintingmesh Polyesterboltingcloth Screen Printing Also Called Serigraphy Or Si Screen Printing Mesh Screen Printing Screen Printing Process" title="Polyesterscreenprintingmesh Polyesterboltingcloth Screen Printing Also Called Serigraphy Or Si Screen Printing Mesh Screen Printing Screen Printing Process" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Ink is forced through the mesh with a squeegee onto the printing surface, which in our case is an adhesive backed vinyl. Over this frame you tightly stretch a piece of sheer fabric (originally silk, now polyester). Silkscreen printing is ideally suited for bold and graphic designs. To start with, the printing frame is created, or rather, the design is printed onto a sheet so that the ink can be transferred.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xe_frLm5zN8/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Silk Screen Printing Exposure Unit Make Screen Images By Burning Uv Light Into Photo Screen Printing Exposure Unit Screen Printing Exposure Screen Printing" title="Silk Screen Printing Exposure Unit Make Screen Images By Burning Uv Light Into Photo Screen Printing Exposure Unit Screen Printing Exposure Screen Printing" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

To start with, the printing frame is created, or rather, the design is printed onto a sheet so that the ink can be transferred. Once exposed to light, the emulsion hardens to the screen and can only be removed with chemicals. There are different methods of preparing screen printing designs which we’ll get into in a minute.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d6/ae/77/d6ae77ae69232aa9010540064d17c1a9.jpg alt="What Is Silk-screen Printing Screen Printing What Is Silk Silk Screen Printing" title="What Is Silk-screen Printing Screen Printing What Is Silk Silk Screen Printing" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
