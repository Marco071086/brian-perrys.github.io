Most ant bait traps are a mixture of something ants are attracted to—usually some sort of protein or carbohydrate—and something poisonous to them. It works by providing the forager ants to eat the product and endure enough time to carry the delicious liquid backward to the den and supply a dose to the rest of the nest. During that time, an exposed ant carries the bait back to the nest and spreads it to other ants, killing them as well.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does terro ant bait work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
