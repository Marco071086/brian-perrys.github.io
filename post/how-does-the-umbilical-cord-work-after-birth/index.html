In the womb, the umbilical cord delivers the oxygen and nutrients needed to allow your baby to grow.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-719dfff6681546c9a1f2a5fb54032556-c alt="What Happens To The Umbilical Cord On The Mothers Side After Birth - Quora" title="What Happens To The Umbilical Cord On The Mothers Side After Birth - Quora" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
