Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Tig welding, sometimes known as gas tungsten arc welding (gtaw), utilizes the electric arc to produce a weld with tungsten electrodes that will not melt or burn off. A tig welder uses a tungsten electrode to deliver current towards the metals to be welded. In a tig torch there is a thin rod made of tungsten which arcs with the ground cable that is connected to the piece of metal to be welded. It is however possible to tig weld without shielding gas and sometimes a specific situation will mean that it is the only viable option for the operator. The pointed electrode is used for this process and it helps in producing high quality and high precision welds.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how does tig welding work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
