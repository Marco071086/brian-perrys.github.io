Emerging studies are suggesting that excess plasticity is a key factor in autism in general, and lindsay�s work has delivered us a tool for measuring that plasticity in anyone.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samet-Kose/publication/304134458/figure/fig3/AS:651593431134218@1532363388823/4-A-typical-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-TMS-circuit-diagram_Q640.jpg alt="A Typical Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Tms Circuit Diagram Download Scientific Diagram" title="A Typical Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Tms Circuit Diagram Download Scientific Diagram" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

There are specific areas of the brain involved in mood regulation. Tms therapy involves a device, which is placed on a patient’s head, that is able to awaken parts of the brain that are underactive in individuals with depression and ocd. It is used primarily for diagnosed depression and anxiety.
