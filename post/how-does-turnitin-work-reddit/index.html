Best bet is to use quotes and paraphrasing sparingly with purpose, and rephrase concepts and idea’s in your own words as much as possible. There are sources that are not in the turnitin database, especially if the material is only available in print. Try it yourself by searching with quotes in google. Even if turnitin searched the entirety of google�s index (it doesn�t), the chances of it finding a match on any given sentence are pretty low.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how does turnitin work reddit by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
