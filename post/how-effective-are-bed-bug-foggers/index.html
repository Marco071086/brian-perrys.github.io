Many insect foggers have the insecticide known as pyrethrin which is effective in the elimination of insects. Foggers should not be used as the sole source of bed bug control. Even if they are, many bed bug populations are resistant to pyrethroids, concluded osu entomologist susan jones, one of.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cd/f9/cf/cdf9cf33b987b7f6ec3727079fd9d375.jpg alt="Can Bed Bug Foggers Affect Your Health - Elmums Health Bed Bugs Contaminated Food" title="Can Bed Bug Foggers Affect Your Health - Elmums Health Bed Bugs Contaminated Food" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
