Because reed diffusers just involve reeds sitting in oil, reed diffusers are easy peasy, look pretty, and smell amazing with minimal effort. They last until all the fragrance oil evaporates. Placing your reed diffuser in an area with good airflow can improve fragrance throw, but bear in mind that increased air circulation will also speed up evaporation, leading to a shorter shelf life. Reed diffusers disperse fragrance constantly until all of the oil is absorbed and has evaporated from the reeds.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cc/e8/72/cce872c57b82cfba9ed96183f86431fe.jpg alt="Coconut Vanilla Bean Diffuser 200ml In 2021 Reed Diffuser Vanilla Bean Coconut" title="Coconut Vanilla Bean Diffuser 200ml In 2021 Reed Diffuser Vanilla Bean Coconut" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
