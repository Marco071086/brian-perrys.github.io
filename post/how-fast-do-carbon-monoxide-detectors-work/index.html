It also has the ability to be unplugged and moved to a new room when you need a quick reading and it won’t go out in a power outage, all thanks to its backup battery. If there’s fairly low carbon monoxide levels, around 50 parts per million (ppm), it could take up to 8 hours for the detector to sound an alarm.

Because carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air and also because it may be found with warm, rising air, detectors should be placed on a wall about 5 feet above the floor. Ideally, your co detectors will each have a test button. This is also called “end of life”. If you’re asking, “does my carbon monoxide detector still work?,” knowing the type of detector you have is important. Since carbon monoxide detectors are electrochemical sensors that detect carbon monoxide gas leaks, they may also detect other gases in the house which can set off the detector alarm.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/82/3c/f3823cb2ab39193ceb8b474ce603cdec.jpg alt="Fike Fike Fire Safety Technology Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detector Fire Safety Detector" title="Fike Fike Fire Safety Technology Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detector Fire Safety Detector" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
