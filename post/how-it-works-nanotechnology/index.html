Ten times the diameter of a hydrogen atom. ­experts sometimes disagree about what constitutes the nanoscale, but in general, you can think of nanotechnology dealing with anything measuring between 1 and 100 nm.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/41/a3/c741a337b186d04b181f1302ae5a1cea.jpg alt="Surface Plasmon Resonance Spr And How It Works Nanotechnology Sensor New Technology" title="Surface Plasmon Resonance Spr And How It Works Nanotechnology Sensor New Technology" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This forces researchers to adopt a manner of working more familiar to scientists in the 19th century than in the 21st. Ten times the diameter of a hydrogen atom. It works by making one molecule (green) move up and down another one (blue and red).</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/fe/3f/65fe3f07335e6b5aa11ed7dcbd7237e3.gif alt="How Nanotechnology Works Nanotechnology Online Science Technology" title="How Nanotechnology Works Nanotechnology Online Science Technology" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
