Originally developed to make sand play less messy, kinetic sand evolved into the squeezable sand that magically sticks together.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8d/4d/73/8d4d73d4d8e337572a4eae09b97b0e32.jpg alt="Diy Kinetic Sand Recipe - Alice And Lois Sands Recipe Diy Kinetic Sand Kinetic Sand" title="Diy Kinetic Sand Recipe - Alice And Lois Sands Recipe Diy Kinetic Sand Kinetic Sand" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
