If a single dose does not completely relieve symptoms, or the infection is severe, fluconazole can be prescribed as three consecutive doses given three days apart. I took 150 mg of fluconazole to clear up the infection and it began to take effect immediately. It can take approximately one week for fluconazole to cure an infection. For mild, uncomplicated, infections fluconazole is prescribed as a single 150 mg dose and an improvement in symptoms is usually seen within one to three days.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.grxstatic.com/d4fuqqd5l3dbz/products/tms/Package_22309.JPG alt="Fluconazole Diflucan Basics Side Effects Reviews" title="Fluconazole Diflucan Basics Side Effects Reviews" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
