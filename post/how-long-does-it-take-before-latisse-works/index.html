Its effects can vary, but it generally takes up to 16 weeks before you see maximum results. You have to remember that latisse is not an overnight solution. For full results, you must use the medication daily for at least two months.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://www.radiancemedspa-wheaton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Latisse-before-and-after.jpg alt="How Does Latisse Work Radiance Skincare Laser Medspa - Wheaton Il" title="How Does Latisse Work Radiance Skincare Laser Medspa - Wheaton Il" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
