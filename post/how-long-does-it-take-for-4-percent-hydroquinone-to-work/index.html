In my experience, this is particularly common after four to five months of satisfactory response in patients using hydroquinone for melasma.

Hydroquinone 4 creams should be applied strictly only to affected areas twice a day, in the morning and just before bedtime, or as directed by your dermatologist.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how long does it take for 4 percent hydroquinone to work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
