The recommended humira dosage for ulcerative colitis (uc) in adults is as follows: It took around 6 months and weekly injections to get me properly into remission. It can take months to feel full effect. Your doctor is jesting with you if you have really been on humira and methotrexate for that long.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.humira.com/content/humira/en-us/ulcerative-colitis/about-humira/humira-dosing-administration/_jcr_content/leftpar/columnlayout_297191444/col-2-1/image/small.img.png alt="Humira Adalimumab For Ulcerative Colitis Dosing And Injection" title="Humira Adalimumab For Ulcerative Colitis Dosing And Injection" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Humira has an average rating of 5.7 out of 10 from a total of 48 ratings for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. It�s only 8 months in so i consider that early days after nearly 30 years of constant disease activity, stricturing and surgeries. Only continue humira in patients who have shown evidence of clinical remission by eight weeks (day 57) of therapy. i read on here of people being on it for four to six months before noticing a change and that seems to go against the manufacturer�s advice. Some patients have experienced fast symptom relief and even remission (few or no symptoms) starting at 8 weeks.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/5a/f7/135af70acd662ca294095eef93a705a8.jpg alt="Pin On Go Do Be Wellness" title="Pin On Go Do Be Wellness" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Uc wrecked my normal activities as i had to stick close to a bathroom and totally changed my diet. Clinical studies have shown that some people start to see results within 4 weeks but most people see them by 8 weeks. So, in general you may feel it is starting to work in a few days of the first loading dose.

I have ulcerative colitis and have been on humira for 6 weeks and have my life back pretty much back to normal now. It is administered by injection under the skin. Hope it works well for you.
