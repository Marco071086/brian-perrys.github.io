It is best to get advice from your doctor as to when it will become effective as it dependant on where you were on your cycle when it was inserted and what type, if any, of contraception you were using before the implanon was inserted. Some women become fertile again immediately once the implanon is removed. The implant is effective after 7 days if it is inserted at any other time in the menstrual cycle. I took it off to change it tonight and it hadn�t healed at all.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how long does it take for implanon to work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
