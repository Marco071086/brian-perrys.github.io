You can have the implant fitted any time after you�ve given birth. You can also get your implant taken out any time before then if. The most important way is by stopping the release of an egg from your ovary.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://media.healthdirect.org.au/images/inline/original/contraceptive-implant-inline-645eaa.gif alt="Contraceptive Implant Healthdirect" title="Contraceptive Implant Healthdirect" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: healthdirect.gov.au</p><p>After removal of implanon, some of the hormones that it has been releasing into your body to control your ovulation will still be effective for a few days. Nexplanon remains effective for three to four years. The above study confirmed that the nexplanon (etonogestrel) still is effective in years 4 and 5 in preventing pregnancy, in some patients at least you may become pregnant as early as a week after the removal of nexplanon. If you’ve had your implant for 5 years and you still don’t want to get pregnant, you need to replace it (or pick another birth control method ). Fertility has been known to be restored in as little as a week and as long as 18 months.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.besthealthmag.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nexplanon-birth-control-implant-hero.jpg alt="The Most Effective Birth Control Available In Canada Best Health" title="The Most Effective Birth Control Available In Canada Best Health" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Nexplanon also thickens the mucus in your cervix and this change may keep sperm from reaching the egg. Depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle when you get the implant, it provides protection beginning either immediately or within a week of the date of insertion. It’s best to wait at least a year—some experts say two—after giving birth to get pregnant again.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title how long does it take for nexplanon to work after pregnancy by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
