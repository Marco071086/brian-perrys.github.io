Source: researchgate.net</p><p>I have taken paxil and paxil cr over the years and it has worked great, even when i cut cold turkey and went through nasty withdrawals. I used to often increase and decrease the mg intake depending on the situations in my life, but during a doctor visit lately he adviced me not to do that as paxil cr does not work when cut, so i switched to paxil 10 mg and stated taking 10mg in morning, afternoon and evening, so i was now on 30 mg of the medicine per day. Common side effects of paxil are nervousness, sleep difficulties (either too much or too little), restlessness, fatigue, dry mouth, nausea, headache, sweating, diarrhea, and sexual problems. For depression and lack of interest in doing activities, I just started seeing a new doctor and he said paxil can take anywhere (depending on the individual) from 4 weeks to 6 months to work.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://asset20.ckassets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/08/Paxil.png alt="Paxil Cr Oral Uses Dosage Price Side Effects Precautions More" title="Paxil Cr Oral Uses Dosage Price Side Effects Precautions More" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
