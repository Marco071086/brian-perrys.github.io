Source: siestio.com</p><p>Zoloft (sertraline hcl) is an ssri antidepressant manufactured by pfizer. Seroquel works pretty quick, at least it does for me. A 50 mg dose is pretty small. Auditory hallucinations & delusions began about a month ago with no prior history of mental illness (we�ve been together 14 years).
