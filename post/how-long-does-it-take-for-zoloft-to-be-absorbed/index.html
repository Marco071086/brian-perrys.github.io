As mentioned above, there will be no difference in effectiveness, regardless of what time of day you take your dose of zoloft. The highest levels of zoloft concentration in the blood are attained within 4 to 6 hours after you take the pill. The most common ones include nausea or upset stomach, diarrhea, sweating, tremor, or a decreased appetite. I was in week 5 (50mg) to this point and had taken the sertraline only with food until then, which seems to have cushioned the impact on the stomach.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://mimsshst.blob.core.windows.net/drug-resources/ID/html/info/Sertraline_01.png alt="Sertraline Indication Dosage Side Effect Precaution Mims Indonesia" title="Sertraline Indication Dosage Side Effect Precaution Mims Indonesia" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Sertraline therapy may be needed for several weeks before beneficial effects are detected. Using saliva, hair, and fingernail samples for drug testing are unusual and not routine. After that, it can take 3 to 6 months for symptoms to improve to the point that you are no longer depressed.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bdaafa5c0da473d3140ee739f70164601e3a005/0_63_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;height=1200&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;s=3bf766b7d7a341db1604dfa2158fd392" alt="How Do Antidepressants Actually Work Neuroscience The Guardian" title="How Do Antidepressants Actually Work Neuroscience The Guardian" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
