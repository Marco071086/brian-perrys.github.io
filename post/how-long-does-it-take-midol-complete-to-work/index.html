I believe the meds tend to get weaker the older that it is, so if it doesn’t work in say, 30 min, i will take another.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/videos/thumbnails/originals/63/0b/82/630b8268e118abf4459d165c7a5f2196-00001.jpg alt="Pin On Its Cause Im Greek" title="Pin On Its Cause Im Greek" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
