Finasteride will never stop working in the real sense but yes, as your hairloss progresses it might not be effective enough and appear to stop working. Instead of upping the dosage to like 2mg or 2.5 mg like specer kobren and many others say is real option (hence this thread i think!), i�ve decided to quit taking finasteride altogether. If you have a psa test done, tell your doctor that you are taking propecia.

In clinical practice, i often increase the dose of finasteride, after someone had been on the medication 3 to 5 years, to help maintain its effectiveness. It would seem to me the drug would have less dht. Instead of upping the dosage to like 2mg or 2.5 mg like specer kobren and many others say is real option (hence this thread i think!), i�ve decided to quit taking finasteride altogether.
