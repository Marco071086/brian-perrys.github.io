The first 2 weeks were difficult with headaches, dizziness, intense panic attacks and suicidal ideation/ images. Zoloft wasn�t ideal med for me years ago (it ramped up the anxiety), and when i retried @ low dose a couple of months ago, one tablet was enough to put me on toilet for hours of painful diarrhea. I have stopped self harming, have more motivation and my anxiety/panic attacks are. After the 2 weeks, i slowly begun to feel a lot better.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://admin.deserthopetreatment.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SSRI-Addiction-Unlikely.png alt="What Is Sertraline Zoloft" title="What Is Sertraline Zoloft" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
