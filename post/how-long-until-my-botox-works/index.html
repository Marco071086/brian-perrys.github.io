Understandably, any patient having botox for the first time eagerly anticipate seeing their results. The results from botox can last for up to six months to a year. It is true that it lasts between 3 and 4 months depending on dose and response, but with regular use patients often see longer duration as muscles weaken.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/92/e3/07/92e3074d1884fd3e70831356ba827f1a--wrinkle-remedies-botox-alternative.jpg alt="2 Bottles Epilift 3 Minute Facelift Botox Alternative Removes Face Eye Wrinkles Face Wrinkles Botox Alternative Eye Wrinkle" title="2 Bottles Epilift 3 Minute Facelift Botox Alternative Removes Face Eye Wrinkles Face Wrinkles Botox Alternative Eye Wrinkle" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It is true that it lasts between 3 and 4 months depending on dose and response, but with regular use patients often see longer duration as muscles weaken. When injected for cosmetic purposes, botox lasts four to six months on average, but you can expect the effects of your first treatment to wear off faster.

You will start to see results when you wake up in the morning on the 2 nd, 3 rd, or 4 th day after being injected. Your muscle movement in the injected area will start to decrease on those days.

When injected for cosmetic purposes, botox lasts four to six months on average, but you can expect the effects of your first treatment to wear off faster. The effects of botox are not reversible, meaning any effect a botox treatment may have on a patient will last until their botox wears off. It is true that it lasts between 3 and 4 months depending on dose and response, but with regular use patients often see longer duration as muscles weaken.
