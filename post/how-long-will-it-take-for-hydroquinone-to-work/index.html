Typically we recommend using 4% hydroquinone twice a day for no longer than 4 months. Best case scenario, you may begin to start noticing some lightening of your skin after a month of regular use. Now let’s compare this to a pa or np: According to mount sinai dermatologist dr gary goldenberg, you can safely use hydroquinone for up to three months at a time.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8d/d4/af/8dd4afbf90eb46278ecc8f2f88e82d93.jpg alt="Pin On Makeup" title="Pin On Makeup" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
