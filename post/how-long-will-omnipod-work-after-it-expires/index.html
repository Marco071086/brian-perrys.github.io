They were happy to oblige. I don�t use the omnipod but i do know that the pods do time out even if there�s plenty of insulin left. Before it completely shuts down and gives you the alarm of death (where it will continually beep) until you change it out.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/c5/b7/3ec5b7aed7f05e331748e014255260b9.jpg alt="My Son Is A Type 1 Diabetic He Wears An Omnipod Insulin Pump He Was Growing Self-conscious Of Wearing Them So Omnipod Type One Diabetes Omnipod Decorations" title="My Son Is A Type 1 Diabetic He Wears An Omnipod Insulin Pump He Was Growing Self-conscious Of Wearing Them So Omnipod Type One Diabetes Omnipod Decorations" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Omnipod says that a pod should be changed 3 days (72 hours) after it has been activated, but that it will remain active another 8 hours after activation, so that you have a total of 80 hours per pod starting at activation. In my other post, darryl (and perhaps some others) mentioned that the pod keeps going 8 hours or so after expiration. what happens after the 72 hours expiration? The booster doses do not fully work immediately.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9f/64/dc/9f64dcf4c132d41c845161341472cfc8.jpg alt="The New Smaller Omnipod - Tubeless Insulin Pump I Think I Will Be Getting This Soon Diabetes Facts Insulin Pump Accessories Insulin Pump" title="The New Smaller Omnipod - Tubeless Insulin Pump I Think I Will Be Getting This Soon Diabetes Facts Insulin Pump Accessories Insulin Pump" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>In my other post, darryl (and perhaps some others) mentioned that the pod keeps going 8 hours or so after expiration. what happens after the 72 hours expiration? It doesn�t stop working after 3 days exactly. (if you decide to use a free apple developer account, you will need to get on the computer every 7 days.) the longer answer is that loop code is updated periodically to include new features and bug fixes. Each time, i would call omnipod to explain the situation and request a replacement pod. The short answer is (1) when you first build and (2) once per year minimum after that.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/28/9d/7a289d896bea9ea058344613c16cd12f.jpg alt="Accessories For My Omnipod Diabetes Bag Omnipod Diabetes" title="Accessories For My Omnipod Diabetes Bag Omnipod Diabetes" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

You can verify this on the omnipod (pod) tab, the pod expires: Dislodged/clogged cannula or pod error requires complete pod replacement; Temp basal limited to 12 hours max.
