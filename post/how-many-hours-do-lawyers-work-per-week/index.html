In a small firm expect to still work around 50 hours per week as a new attorney. That comes out to about 42 hours a week.

They work anywhere from 20 to 80 hours per week depending on their clients’ and firms’ demands. (adding a sixth day brings the average to 5.67 hours per day.)</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/8d/47/cb8d47b5dc86fcab42b3134fb406e06e.jpg alt="After Hours Legal Advice From Solicitors In Gold Coast Legal Advice Solicitor Notary Public" title="After Hours Legal Advice From Solicitors In Gold Coast Legal Advice Solicitor Notary Public" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
