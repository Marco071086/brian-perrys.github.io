This is a long slow progress to recovery but these meds do work in time but you need both patience and persistence. As i�m always up around noon, this became my dosage time and i�ve been consistent with it for decades. Then it stopped working for me, which can happen when you take an antidepressant for a long time. This promotes the feelings of being content and overall happiness of the dog, in turn decreasing anxiety and depression.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a1/ae/6b/a1ae6b6ef4c77ba33f5cf44006421ed5.jpg alt="Pin On Alopecia Health" title="Pin On Alopecia Health" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
