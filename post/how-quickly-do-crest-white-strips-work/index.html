The strips are made of a plastic material and are coated with adhesive and hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide whitening gel. Your results might vary as a result of the nature of staining of your teeth. Many dentists recommend these strips to their patients. The gel is pressed against the teeth for several minutes to penetrate the enamel layer and “bleach” teeth.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how quickly do crest white strips work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
