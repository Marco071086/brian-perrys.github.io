You will begin to see the effects wearing off within several weeks after your first treatment, but breakdown will take longer after each treatment. The effects of botox are not reversible, meaning any effect a botox treatment may have on a patient will last until their botox wears off. The toxin does not work immediately. Stay still but pay attention and follow your doctor�s instructions.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/79/a5/b879a587285578d2a40629edfc8dd900.jpg alt="Botox Vs Fillers Which Will Work Best For You Free Infographic Botox Fillers Botox Medical Skin Care" title="Botox Vs Fillers Which Will Work Best For You Free Infographic Botox Fillers Botox Medical Skin Care" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
