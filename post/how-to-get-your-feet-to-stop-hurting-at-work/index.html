This is perhaps the most common and obvious solution to the problem, but it works perfectly. Keeping your muscles warm and stretching can help your legs and feet not to hurt so much at the end of a long day. Eat food that’s good for you and your back. If possible, try and elevate your feet on a chair or step as this will reduce swelling.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title how to get your feet to stop hurting at work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
