Once the fire is going well there should be much less smoke and at this point it is important to keep fueling the fire with wood to keep the temperature hot enough to. Much like a charcoal grill, these holes are designed to allow air flow to travel up from beneath the bulk of your fuel and fire. You can use rocks or bricks as these are good insulators of heat which helps keep the fire going longer.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f7/c3/c0/f7c3c0eaef00ad8e7f5e98011abfc0ab.jpg alt="Flame Genie Fire Pit Smoke Free And Sparkless Feuerstelle Garten Feuerstelle Feuer" title="Flame Genie Fire Pit Smoke Free And Sparkless Feuerstelle Garten Feuerstelle Feuer" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

A grate is a metal frame that sits at the bottom of the fire pit.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/74/78/e37478ee2ed8cdfbc2b8f58f60fdb53e.jpg alt="More Fun With Fire The Dakota Fire Pit Make Dakota Fire Dakota Fire Pit Dakota Fire Hole" title="More Fun With Fire The Dakota Fire Pit Make Dakota Fire Dakota Fire Pit Dakota Fire Hole" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
