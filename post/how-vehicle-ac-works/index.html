The incoming air is heated as it passes through a heater matrix (a small radiator) which holds the hot engine coolant. An air conditioner (ac) in a room or a car works by collecting hot air from a given space, processing it within itself with the help of a refrigerant and a bunch of coils and then releasing cool air into the same space where the hot air had originally been collected. In an electric car, none of these components exist.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/ec/5f/a0ec5f796f08b48f68a9dceaa5b7984c.gif alt="Eco Friendly Air Source Heat Pumps Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Automotive Repair" title="Eco Friendly Air Source Heat Pumps Car Air Conditioning Air Conditioning System Automotive Repair" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>The role of the vehicle’s air conditioning system is to dry the outside air coming into the speed machine and cool the air and allow the air to pass through the air conditioning vents. This allows fresh air coming from the outside of the vehicle to come in contact with the liquid refrigerant. Sometimes, the mold is formed due to the presence of fungal elements. This system is controlled by a main computer which sits in the dash and also houses the controls for the mode and temperature settings.
