A carbon monoxide detector or co detector is a device that detects the presence of the carbon monoxide (co) gas to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. They help deter the buildup of carbon monoxide. Figuring out how long do carbon monoxide detectors last may vary from product to product and brand to brand. Since carbon monoxide detectors are electrochemical sensors that detect carbon monoxide gas leaks, they may also detect other gases in the house which can set off the detector alarm.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c6/ee/2c/c6ee2c7e497d7a925c6a429ad464fe87.jpg alt="Best Smoke Detector Nest Vs Kidde Vs First Alert Vs Brk More Smoke Detector Safety Gadgets Fire Detectors" title="Best Smoke Detector Nest Vs Kidde Vs First Alert Vs Brk More Smoke Detector Safety Gadgets Fire Detectors" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Carbon monoxide detectors trigger an alarm based on an accumulation of carbon monoxide over time. It is critically important that you test the alarm to ensure its functionality. This is the part of the device that actually detects the co concentration in the room. The most important component of a carbon monoxide alarm is the sensor:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/de/cd/9c/decd9c90fcea45069a988ef8c26742ed.jpg alt="First Alert Battery Operated Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detector Alarm-sco5cn - The Home Depot Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detector Carbon Monoxide Detector Smoke Detector" title="First Alert Battery Operated Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detector Alarm-sco5cn - The Home Depot Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detector Carbon Monoxide Detector Smoke Detector" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

They measure a chemical reaction within the sensor that creates an electrical output proportional to the co level. This is why more states are putting regulations into effect regarding carbon monoxide detectors in homes, schools, hotels, and motels.
