Because they don’t use ducts, ductless acs transmit. Ducts carry your home�s air to this central location, where it is cooled and then returned to your home via more ducts. Now in a regular split system air conditioner, the indoor unit is in the attic or closet. So exactly how do ductless air conditioners work? Heat energy from the indoor air is absorbed by the refrigerant, and the resulting cooler air is pushed into the living area by the internal blower.</p><h3 id=however-while-central-air-conditioning-uses-one-centrally-located-indoor-unit-that-delivers-cool-air-to-the-entire-home-through-a-series-of-ducts-and-vents-a-ductless-indoor-unit-blows-cooled-air-directly-into-one-living-space>However, while central air conditioning uses one centrally located indoor unit that delivers cool air to the entire home through a series of ducts and vents, a ductless indoor unit blows cooled air directly into one living space.</h3><p>Heat energy from the indoor air is absorbed by the refrigerant, and the resulting cooler air is pushed into the living area by the internal blower. While ductless air conditioning systems work well in older buildings, they are also a welcome addition to new buildings. Ductless air conditioner systems use the same process for cooling as a typical central air conditioning system. Duct leakage leads to the wastage of 20 to 30 percent of conditioned air, according to energy.gov. You can link 4 indoor units.

Ductless systems don’t lose hot or cold air due to duct leakage. First, a standard hvac system for central heat and air conditioning consists of a system of ducts inside a building’s walls through which air travels to warm or cool the whole building.
