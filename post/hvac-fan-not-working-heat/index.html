If you are not getting 24 volts between these two wires then you have a thermostat problem or a thermostat wire problem. When your furnace is off (if you turn it off, or if it is warm enough in your house that your furnace doesn’t need to run), this is what senses that there is no heat being generated by your heat exchanger and tells your fan to turn off (because if it didn’t, it would be blowing unheated air throughout your house and wasting energy). You need to move air across the outdoor coil so it can absorb heat from the outside air and transfer that heat to the indoor coil.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/03/f9/3c03f911ac1e14f3f8adf9637d2370a8.jpg alt="Furnace Blower Motor Replacement Hvac Furnace Repair Air Conditioning Maintenance" title="Furnace Blower Motor Replacement Hvac Furnace Repair Air Conditioning Maintenance" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Your thermostat controls the temperature and heat settings of the gas furnace. The outdoor fan motor is as crucial as the indoor fan motor.

Perhaps your blower motor has burnt out and you need a new one. A picture of the control board or the wiring of the furnace would help, along with the model, serial, and age of the equipment When you place the switch in the auto position, the fan will only activate when the air has been heated to the correct temperature.
