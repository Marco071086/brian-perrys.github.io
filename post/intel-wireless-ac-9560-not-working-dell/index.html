This has happened to me once before. Also the last two resets did not solve. If you had your other card working from install, that is when it was detected and the proper drivers for that other card were installed, now you got a different card, needs different driver. If this does not work, undo the back cover and check the intel ac 9560 card if it hasn’t moved out of its slots and/or there is no oxidation on the slots, take the card out and clean it and also, make sure that the two white/black arial wires are also pugged in correctly and fully.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://thegeekpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/uninstall-network.png alt="Fix Wifi Stopped Automatically- Intel Ac 9560 Code 10 Error In Windows 10" title="Fix Wifi Stopped Automatically- Intel Ac 9560 Code 10 Error In Windows 10" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Note this is not the code 10 error that many others were having with this same adapter model. Start at the top and work your way down to find the one that works. The laptop does not detect any wifi. Until….today when i started it.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://cf.shopee.co.id/file/92c08ac24680ef6ea6a6f2ebb848b808 alt="Dual Band Wireless Ac 9260 Untuk Intel 9260ngw Ngff 80211ac Mu-mimo 1730 Mbps 173 Gbps Wifi Shopee Indonesia" title="Dual Band Wireless Ac 9260 Untuk Intel 9260ngw Ngff 80211ac Mu-mimo 1730 Mbps 173 Gbps Wifi Shopee Indonesia" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Start at the top and work your way down to find the one that works. Original equipment manufacturers (oems) may limit the computer to only specific wireless adapters, causing an installation error when booting with a different, previously installed wireless adapter. Now, there is no listing for the proset software in my add/remove programs.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a0/14/ee/a014ee9be4866221372e04e25a39fd24.jpg alt="Fenvi Dual Band 450mbps Wifi Wlan For Intel 6300 633anhmw Wireless-n 80211agn Mini Pci-e Card For Acer Asus Dell Toshiba Pci Card Wifi Card Networking" title="Fenvi Dual Band 450mbps Wifi Wlan For Intel 6300 633anhmw Wireless-n 80211agn Mini Pci-e Card For Acer Asus Dell Toshiba Pci Card Wifi Card Networking" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

They are getting a code 10 on the device in the device manager and it seems to repeat the driver install but fails. It has been with geek squad for day 3 trying to remedy the problem.
