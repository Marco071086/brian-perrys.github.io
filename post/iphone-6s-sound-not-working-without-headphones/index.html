Start by restarting your iphone to rule out the possibility of iphone going into headphone mode due to a software glitch. The easiest way to make sure a software problem isn’t causing your iphone to stay stuck in headphones mode is to turn it off and back on again. To update, open settings → general → software update. Update iphone to the latest software.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/07/45/3c074584e8492f27b612dfd5806fc342.jpg alt="Wireless V40 Bluetooth Sweatproof Sports Ear Hook Headset Wbuilt-in Hd Audio Mic Top Quality Wireless V40 Bluetooth Sw Sweatproof Bluetooth Headset Headset" title="Wireless V40 Bluetooth Sweatproof Sports Ear Hook Headset Wbuilt-in Hd Audio Mic Top Quality Wireless V40 Bluetooth Sw Sweatproof Bluetooth Headset Headset" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you can�t hear any sound or if your speaker button on the ringer and alerts slider is dimmed, your speaker may need servicing. This is the number one reason your apps or games have no sound. Go to settings > sounds (or settings > sounds & haptics), and drag the ringer and alerts slider back and forth a few times. Go to settings > general > shut down.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4e/95/3f/4e953f85c9d1aac0b302a7f87b5ea1c3.png alt="Pin On Trending Styles" title="Pin On Trending Styles" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
