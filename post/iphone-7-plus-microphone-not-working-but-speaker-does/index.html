One on the back for recording video audio, one on the bottom for speakerphone calls and other voice recordings, and one in the earpiece for phone calls. I also replaced the microphone on the top (front camera, microphone, censor) and restore firmware but problem still there. It can block the sound to reach the microphone. Its microphone is not working in speaker phone mode, facetime, video call but it works fine on siri, voice recording and video recording.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title iphone 7 plus microphone not working but speaker does by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
