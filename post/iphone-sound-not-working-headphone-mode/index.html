The iphone was basically locked into headphone mode (noticed via the volume change hud), where and sound was not playing back through the speakers. Turn on the bluetooth of your iphone by going to settings >> bluetooth. When you cannot hear any sound through your headphones, you should remove them or replace with original headphones. Your iphone 6 is stuck in headphone mode because it�s being tricked into thinking headphones are plugged.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title iphone sound not working headphone mode by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
