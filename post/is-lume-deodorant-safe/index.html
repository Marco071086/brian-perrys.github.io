We recommend working lume into your regular hygiene routine just a few times a week rather than right before anticipated intimacy so you will be the only one who ever knows you are using it. Will it help control wetness, too? I�ve used it approximately 60x, pea sized amount per pit and i still have some left. Lume is a new company that makes natural deodorants and similar products for both men and women.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/81/fa/5c81fa406ee77b65e47be04bf8de478d.jpg alt="Lume For Women Unscented Deodorant Deodorant Natural Deodorant" title="Lume For Women Unscented Deodorant Deodorant Natural Deodorant" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
