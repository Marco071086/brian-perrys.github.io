Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Right to cure state utah: Virginia law only requires written notice of the intent to repossess if the lender intends to charge you the cost of repossessing and selling the motor vehicle. It is the intent of the general assembly that this chapter shall be applied as remedial legislation to promote fair and ethical standards of dealings between suppliers and the consuming public. Because they did not notify you ten (10) days prior to the repossession, they may not charge you for the repossession or sale of the vehicle.
