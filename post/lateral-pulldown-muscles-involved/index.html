In this action your arms are pulled down in a side (lateral) plane until your upper arm is below shoulder level. And the teres major, teres minor. The latissimus dorsi, or “lats”, for short, are going to be the primary muscle trained during the close grip lat pulldown. ‘lat’ is short for latissimus dorsi which is the name of the muscle being worked.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/58/eb/ee/58ebeea6c5a2bade49090baee5864de2.png alt="Double Cable Neutral-grip Lat Pull-down Exercise Instructions And Video Good Back Workouts Cable Workout Back Exercises" title="Double Cable Neutral-grip Lat Pull-down Exercise Instructions And Video Good Back Workouts Cable Workout Back Exercises" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When you use the wide grip for shoulder adduction, the assisting muscles are the coracobrachialis, subscapularis (when your arm is above the horizontal), short head of the biceps, and long head of the triceps. While the midback is involved somewhat in the pulldown movement (depending heavily on how it’s done), the vertical line of pull tends to take the midback muscles out of the movement. Secondary muscle groups involved in a lat pulldown include your traps, which perform shrugging movements and run across the top of your shoulders to your neck; The muscles responsible for depressing the scapula are also very active in the lat pull down.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9a/84/92/9a8492d7b442d1fb4eb02e3fb627a9d3.jpg alt="Mastering The Wide-grip Lat Pull-down Guide Form Flaws Set Up Execution - Gymguidercom Cable Workout Back Workout Bodybuilding Upper Body Workout For Women" title="Mastering The Wide-grip Lat Pull-down Guide Form Flaws Set Up Execution - Gymguidercom Cable Workout Back Workout Bodybuilding Upper Body Workout For Women" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The largest of these muscles, the lats, originate at your thoracic and lumbar spine spanning most of your back and insert all the way on your humerus. While the midback is involved somewhat in the pulldown movement (depending heavily on how it’s done), the vertical line of pull tends to take the midback muscles out of the movement.

They include the rhomboids, levator scapulae, the lower trapezius and to an extent pectoralis minor. In this action your arms are pulled down in a side (lateral) plane until your upper arm is below shoulder level. It performs the functions of downward rotation and depression of the scapulae combined with adduction and extension of the shoulder joint.
