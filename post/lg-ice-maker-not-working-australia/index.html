Common problems that result in the lg ice maker not working include kinks in the water line, a water filter that is incorrectly placed in the cavity or a dirty water filter that needs to be replaced entirely. If the control board on your lg refrigerator is not sending power to the ice maker, or one of the relays on the control board has failed, then the ice maker will not run.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://lgfridgefilter.com.au/img/cms/description/reset.png alt="No Ice" title="No Ice" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
