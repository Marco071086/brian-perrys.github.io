While you may want a professional refrigerator repair service to confirm this, changing the ice level control board could prevent the need. Also the light on the ice maker selector inside the door goes on and off with the switch.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://removeandreplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Refrigerator-Icemaker-Jammed-Ice-Stuck-In-Chute.jpg alt="Refrigerator Ice Maker Jammed - Ice Cubes Stuck In Door Chute" title="Refrigerator Ice Maker Jammed - Ice Cubes Stuck In Door Chute" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Locate the ice maker�s on/off switch on the left side of the unit. If the refrigerator has an on/off switch or slide, the switch should be moved to the on position.
