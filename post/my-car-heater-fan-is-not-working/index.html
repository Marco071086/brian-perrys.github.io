If the car’s blower fan isn’t working, you won’t get enough heated or cooled air onto the windshield to defrost it. Along the same lines as the coolant system issues, a malfunctioning thermostat. The lower speeds are accomplished by running the power supply through various resistors that drop the voltage which makes the blower turn at different speeds. The fan inside your car then blows heat off of it to give the cabin heat.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/4c/df/344cdf0dd0e38e93146334579192dc3d.jpg alt="Ac Radiator Fan Fix - Vw Polo 9n 2003 Radiator Fan Fan Repair Radiators" title="Ac Radiator Fan Fix - Vw Polo 9n 2003 Radiator Fan Fan Repair Radiators" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
