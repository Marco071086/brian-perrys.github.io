Now that the cold weather is back, we�ll be whacking the car�s heater on the second we turn the key. I don’t believe i have a shut off valve for the coolant line to the bunk.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/16/25/72/16257267df91e30ff8dff496b1350ec5.jpg alt="Pin On My Saves" title="Pin On My Saves" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I went under the bunk and popped one of the coolant lines off the evaporator core and hot coolant went everywhere. While there are a variety of reasons your chevrolet silverado 1500 heater is not working, the most common 3 are a broken heater blower motor, a problem with the thermostat, or a failed heater blower motor resistor. If it isn�t, it could be because the heater control valve is not sending hot coolant to into the system.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/63/5d/12/635d12766fccb727d6ff19ed4fe64e1f.jpg alt="Drifting Land Rover Land Rover Land Rover Defender Land Rover Series" title="Drifting Land Rover Land Rover Land Rover Defender Land Rover Series" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Do this by running the engine with the heat on for a while, then shut it off and feel the hoses that lead to the heater core, be careful they do get hot.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b9/d1/ae/b9d1ae2f3d2abd6c8d6c33f5b8a0d98e--dead-link.jpg alt="Pin On Truck" title="Pin On Truck" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Check the blower motor, is it turning “on” When your coolant/antifreeze levels drop, the hot fluid can’t make it to the heater core, and thus, your cabin remains chilly. While there are a variety of reasons your chevrolet silverado 1500 heater is not working, the most common 3 are a broken heater blower motor, a problem with the thermostat, or a failed heater blower motor resistor. I bought the truck this past spring and with the days getting colder noticed that my heat does not work as it should.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/7d/cb/1e7dcbd53f133339ef8fd1eeb68bee84.jpg alt="How To Fix A Car With No Heat Easy Auto Repair No Heat Car" title="How To Fix A Car With No Heat Easy Auto Repair No Heat Car" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

First check your coolant level, then check to make sure your heater core isnt clogged. The heater control value isn’t working. Turn the heat on high.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site serviceableness, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title my heater is not working in my truck by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
