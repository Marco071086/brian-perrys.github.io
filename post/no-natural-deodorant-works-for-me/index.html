I know it sounds gross, but if you use a body brush and scrub them only with water, and then use the deodorant stone after your shower, you won�t stink. Try wearing natural fabrics when making the switch. When a friend recommended arm & hammer essentials deodorant, i was skeptical, but willing to give it a try.to my surprise, it works! I wore woman’s antiperspirant, men’s antiperspirant, “clinical strength” antiperspirant.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f0/d7/88/f0d7883d053553d54d3cbce67398c14f.jpg alt="Pin On Health Wellness" title="Pin On Health Wellness" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I wore woman’s antiperspirant, men’s antiperspirant, “clinical strength” antiperspirant. Somehow, i still had armpit sweat and the stinkies.

However, if you find that this deodorant just isn’t working for you, then you may need to give your underarms a little boost with an armpit detox. Absorbs sweat and neutralizes odor without leaving your body any harm as it is paraben and aluminum free.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7c/06/33/7c06332b1536a53e15599b2b3b1c4f39.jpg alt="Primally Pure 100 Natuour Natural Deodorant Stands Out From The Rest Because It Natural Deodorant Deodorant Best Natural Deodorant" title="Primally Pure 100 Natuour Natural Deodorant Stands Out From The Rest Because It Natural Deodorant Deodorant Best Natural Deodorant" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
