Some vehicles may specify different summer and winter oil blends. If your using a decent oil but not changing it every 3000 miles and letting go alot more (standard oils not synthetic) then you need to change your habits. Oil level not reading after oil change decided to change the oil myself on my 2014 991 carrera s cabrio having just bought it with 7k miles and prefer to change the oil at 12m intervals. If you have been using a cheap oil, stop.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZ1kKGC5vrI/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Chevy Truck No Oil Pressure Oil Pressure Gauge Not Working - Youtube" title="Chevy Truck No Oil Pressure Oil Pressure Gauge Not Working - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
