Cold weather can also make the oil pressure read low until the oil pump has had a chance to deliver the oil to the engine. The causes for this range from a faulty gauge to the need for an oil change. Running your engine with low or zero oil pressure can and will destroy it in minutes.

I do know of a remote oil pressure gauge mounting kit, that includes everything you need. You have to drain out the excess oil, and hopefully that problem will be fixed. It has a 7psi switch. It controls the gauge on a vehicle, which lights up as a warning indicator.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://revlimiter.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_5775.jpg alt="Miata Oil Gauge Real Vs Fake Revlimiternet" title="Miata Oil Gauge Real Vs Fake Revlimiternet" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
