Being the owner of a 2003 gmc i knew there were problems with instrument panel clusters so i thought for sure that was the problem. If it doesn�t gauge is bad. Twice now i�ve had the warning on my display and the fast beeping alarm.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zgpg4xS1hBE/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Chevy Gmc No Oil Pressure Gauge Reading - Youtube" title="Chevy Gmc No Oil Pressure Gauge Reading - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Starts out showing pegged at 80 psi, then will occasionally drop to 0,. #2 · jun 15, 2012. While driving all of the gauges (speedometer, gas, voltage, fluid, etc.) simultaneously fail. The low oil pressure causes are due to several problems such as inaccurate gauge, oil pressure in excess, oil inlet tube leak or restriction, broken relief spring of oil pressure, or camshaft clearance.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c4/f9/86/c4f986163191153a88c4c109457f1562.jpg alt="Pin On Products" title="Pin On Products" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The lubrication system pressure is based on: You need to check the oil pressure with a mechanical oil pressure gauge first. Truck started and ran just fine.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f9/30/be/f930bebd0ce8b2416dd8a3ede3a30e4b.jpg alt="Pin On Rodas" title="Pin On Rodas" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When this is not working it may cause the gauge to display intermittently incorrect readings, sometimes saying 0 pressure and sometimes max (in this case 80 psi) or sometimes it fluctuates erratically. After engine is at running temp oil runs at 60 psi, when at idle it may drop to 40 psi after it is hot.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title oil pressure gauge not working on 2005 chevy silverado by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
