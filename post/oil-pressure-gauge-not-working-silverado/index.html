Tyes1576000h (flying disc :15 np) watch later. I have an 08 silverado 4.8l that�s reading 0 oil pressure all the time. My oil pressure gauge just spiked on my 03 silverado but it is more than 7 years old so the recall won�t work for me.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5e/b4/ca/5eb4ca191c87a37c506cd58805d3ddaf.jpg alt="Fix The Chevy Engine Oil Pressure Problem For Good Oil Pressure Chevy Car Repair Diy" title="Fix The Chevy Engine Oil Pressure Problem For Good Oil Pressure Chevy Car Repair Diy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Im out of ideas to check my grounds are good, my cluster is good, all fuses and wires as far as i can trace them. The 03+ trucks use a 3 wire oil pressure sensor that sends an oil pressure reading to the ecm, and it sends out the oil pressure reading over the data bus where the cluster picks it up and tells the stepper where to put the needle at.

When i turn the key on they go all the way to the right of the cluster and dont return to the normal position at any time while the vehicle is on. Oil pressure gauge reading too low , generally below 15 to 20 psi while idling. Good luck, hope this helps. The gauge works fine in another.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1f/94/a5/1f94a557ad0891f70b537d471b15d344.jpg alt="Rays Chevy Restoration Site &amp;ndash; Chevy Mechanical Oil Pressure Gauge Information Oil Pressure Pressure Gauge Oil Light" title="Rays Chevy Restoration Site &amp;ndash; Chevy Mechanical Oil Pressure Gauge Information Oil Pressure Pressure Gauge Oil Light" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
