There is also a gfi breaker in the electrical panel for all the bathrooms upstairs (bedroom level). The older model, which sold in blister packs, and later in the black & green boxes, model 3130 had a well known tendency to first stop reporting on/off status, then eventually stop responding altogether. There is an outdoor light right above it that works just fine with an indoor switch. Reset button doesn’t pop out when pushing “test” reset button doesn’t stay.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/c3/76/ebc3761f1bbd2ca124b4bc971ae03482.png alt="Abbotech 15a Tamper Resistant Duplex Receptacle Standard Wall Outlet Decorative Electrical Outlet Child Proof S Wall Outlets Plates On Wall Electrical Outlets" title="Abbotech 15a Tamper Resistant Duplex Receptacle Standard Wall Outlet Decorative Electrical Outlet Child Proof S Wall Outlets Plates On Wall Electrical Outlets" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
