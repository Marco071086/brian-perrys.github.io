If upon pressing the “test” button on the receptacle, it doesn’t pop back out, you might not have power to the gfci. Verify that all gfci outlets and circuit breakers function properly by pressing the test button, and then the reset button. Check every receptacle, switch, or other junction on the circuit. Worked when power first back on but when i flipped breakers to get power to.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/86/41/ff/8641ffc17a97237b6de478e4aac048f3--flowchart-outlets.jpg alt="Electrical Outage Diagnostic Flowchart Electricity Outage Flow Chart Electricity" title="Electrical Outage Diagnostic Flowchart Electricity Outage Flow Chart Electricity" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you want to confirm before running out for a new one, turn the breaker off, pull the outlet, ensure nothing is shorted, turn the breaker back on and check the screws on the outlet for power. Still, and you are facing a power outage only in that outlet then there is a fault in the outlet itself. One is auto reset and after a power outage, when power is restored, it will pass power. If a recent power outage has occurred, turn off the household circuit breaker for the range for one (1) minute.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/56/80/6f5680d0fd62ac508d07376b289e0afc.jpg alt="Woods Electrical Outlet Timer Indoor 24-hour Digital Plug-in 1 Polarized 2 Pack Woods Power Saver Timer Digital Light" title="Woods Electrical Outlet Timer Indoor 24-hour Digital Plug-in 1 Polarized 2 Pack Woods Power Saver Timer Digital Light" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Arc fault detectors have the same problem, only worse. Refrigerators use gfci electrical outlets and during the power outage, it may have been tripped, which requires flipping the breaker to fix the issue or pressing the reset button on the faceplate. I checked the circuit breakers in the cellar and all seem fine. Then, look for blown fuses in your circuit breaker.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/53/f7/bc/53f7bcc953ea9d0b732ca6557ae8429e--electrical-safety-electrical-outlets.jpg alt="Pin On Safety First Safety Always" title="Pin On Safety First Safety Always" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

However, the electronics in those things are a bit finicky and sometimes noise or irregularities on the power like will cause them to trip. If they are properly connected then make the connection right. Note the outlets without any power going to them and unplug your appliances in the room before heading over to your breaker box.
