After noticing that your gfci outlet is not working, you’ll likely want to head to your circuit breaker. If you�ve tested for power at each location, and there is none, then you have an open circuit somewhere. Every other room had its lights on, and i went and checked the breaker and noticed that it hasn�t tripped. The light switch has stopped working.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/bf/f0/ff/bff0ffe41808926b710905bae5464d4d.jpg alt="Only 100 Orders Leftoutlet Wall Plate With Led Night Lights-no Batteries Or Wires Ul Fcc Csa Certified Led Night Light Night Light Cover Plates On Wall" title="Only 100 Orders Leftoutlet Wall Plate With Led Night Lights-no Batteries Or Wires Ul Fcc Csa Certified Led Night Light Night Light Cover Plates On Wall" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

That is why you can have a situation where the breaker is supplying power to the circuit, but the outlet (receptacle, light, appliance, etc.) is not working. Using a voltage tester, you can verify whether or not electricity is flowing through the lights. However, you should take a few minutes to check the other outlets, appliances, and lights in your home to see if anything else is being affected.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/43/40/454340950db12cda8773153d491774dc.jpg alt="471 Likes 50 Comments - Dowsing Reynolds Dowsingandreynolds On Instagram Our Black Sockets May Be Understated But They Def Plug Socket Dowsing Sockets" title="471 Likes 50 Comments - Dowsing Reynolds Dowsingandreynolds On Instagram Our Black Sockets May Be Understated But They Def Plug Socket Dowsing Sockets" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Since you�ve reset the breakers, it�s likely downstream from the panel. The green light will only come on if the outlet is working properly and it has power. I thought it was a problem with the lights but i tested them and they work. If it lights up and makes noise, you still have power.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bc/83/d8/bc83d8eefa45d9ba887be94bb401a7f7.jpg alt="Iclever Smart Outlets Are Effective But Tricky To Set Up Simple Lighting Indicator Lights Life App" title="Iclever Smart Outlets Are Effective But Tricky To Set Up Simple Lighting Indicator Lights Life App" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
