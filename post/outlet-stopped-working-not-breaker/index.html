If a breaker flips, you’ll see that it’s now in the middle ‒ neither off nor on. If the breaker stays engaged, but the outlet still doesn’t work, turn the breaker back off and continue troubleshooting. If your outlet has short circuited or been overloaded, then your circuit breaker may have shut off its power. To reset the breaker, place it in the off position and then switch it on the opposite side.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d0/ee/ae/d0eeae14760e9efb5bfea2dca77243cd.jpg alt="Circuit Breaker Labels Breaker Panel Circuit Breaker Panel Electrical Panel" title="Circuit Breaker Labels Breaker Panel Circuit Breaker Panel Electrical Panel" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
