If there is no gfci device in the circuit, by all means replace the outdoor outlet with a new one. As you can see, there are many reasons for a faulty outdoor outlet not working. I have looked to make sure that there is no tripped gfci. Firmly press test and then reset which should resolve the issue.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title outside outlet not working no gfci by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
