Now we have implemented both the repository pattern and the unit of work pattern with the appropriate abstractions and thier concrete implementations. The unit of work pattern is used to group one or more operations (usually database crud operations) into a single transaction or “unit of work” so that all operations either pass or fail as one unit. Entity framework really does implement these patterns, if you think about it. Same pattern can be used to maintain a.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fa/06/cd/fa06cd3df0909f1e789f068a4df6e71c.jpg alt="Developing A Sample Project In Repository Design Pattern With The Combination Of Entity Frameworks Code First Unit O Entity Framework Web Api Pattern Design" title="Developing A Sample Project In Repository Design Pattern With The Combination Of Entity Frameworks Code First Unit O Entity Framework Web Api Pattern Design" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
