My peacock on my ps4 works, but after ten seconds of playing anything the sound starts to continuously loop a single second�s worth of time and it builds up static and sounds like the 9 hells have opened. Once locked, a parental control pin is required before you can access the peacock app. You can still sign up for peacock and use it on other devices like amazon fire tv, apple tv, google chromecast, roku, android tv, iphone/ipad, android phone/tablet, mac, windows, xbox, lg smart tv, samsung smart tv, sony smart tv, and vizio smart tv.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://cdn2.downdetector.com/static/uploads/logo/download-9.png alt="Peacock Down Current Outages And Problems Downdetector" title="Peacock Down Current Outages And Problems Downdetector" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
