The problem with kayak/ladder racks that are commercially available, is that they don�t leave room for the tonneau cover. Installing a truck rack on top of a tonneau cover will take extra steps but doesn�t have to be complicated.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/5d/07/975d070acd915a028cec3a3dd0e4353c.jpg alt="Pin On Biking" title="Pin On Biking" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
