Power outlet ratings in a 2000 sienna would anyone know, or be able to look up, the power outlet rating of the upper and lower receptacles in the front and the single one in the back, and if each is on it�s own circuit or if they�re in series. Also, there is no cigarette lighter as the older models have, its just a power outlet. Fuses did not look blown, but this morning i changed three of them in the panel under the dash having to do with power outlets, so i checked the relay using the guide and it was bad.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/57/f2/3c/57f23cfba610ddd9e63cadd3f9e7ecda.jpg alt="Pin On 2021 Toyota Sienna" title="Pin On 2021 Toyota Sienna" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The manual seems to imply it is total for both outlets combined but does not say so explicitly :confuse:</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/55/17/635517d78d7d1ee057cfff3d3b6d103e.jpg alt="Front Master Power Window Switch Driver Side Left For Toyota Camry Vios Sienna Scion Xa 84820-33170 Auto Parts Shop Window Master Toyota Camry" title="Front Master Power Window Switch Driver Side Left For Toyota Camry Vios Sienna Scion Xa 84820-33170 Auto Parts Shop Window Master Toyota Camry" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
