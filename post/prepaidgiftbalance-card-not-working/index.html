Call prepaidgiftbalance.com, speak to a person, register your address ( after which, they will make you let the card rest for 24 hours which means no charges may be attempted in that time), then have the card info removed from any site that may* try to run it for payment ( like amazon) The address you gave to make an online or phone purchase is different from the address you have on file with your prepaid card provider.
