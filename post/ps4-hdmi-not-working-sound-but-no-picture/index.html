The ps4 connects fine to my sony tv in the living room. I have done multiple troubleshooting steps but none have worked.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://www.sony.com/articleimage/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=0155F000007IKkUQAW" alt="The Tv Screen Is Black When The Playstation 4 Pro Is Connected To An Av Receiver Or Home Theater Sony Usa" title="The Tv Screen Is Black When The Playstation 4 Pro Is Connected To An Av Receiver Or Home Theater Sony Usa" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The connection between the television and the console cannot interpret the output signal from the ps4 and reconcile it with the television’s native output capacity. If you find sound not coming through hdmi after connecting your computer to an hdmi device, please follow the methods below to solve the problem. If your ps4 screen goes black when trying to play a disc or game, it may have something to do.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title ps4 hdmi not working sound but no picture by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
