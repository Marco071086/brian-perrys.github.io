This fan should come on and remain on when the a/c system is operating. (except for some reason at 100%, then it shuts off.) this makes me think that the pink / purple wire is ok. Checked volts at clucth only have 4 volts, but thats 4 volts at all times, key on or off ac on or off, always 4 volts. Perfectly normal, it just means your coolant temp is still higher than set point so your fan will stay running even with engine off till the temperature reaches set point of about 190f 90 c.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/36/cc/6f36cccf45efca7ef1dc6e9e15f54c2d.jpg alt="Free Deliveryaa1282hb-at New Original Exchange 220v12038 Axial Cooling Fan Cooling Fan Fan Ac Fan" title="Free Deliveryaa1282hb-at New Original Exchange 220v12038 Axial Cooling Fan Cooling Fan Fan Ac Fan" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If the fan motor, motor relay or wiring is defective, the fan may not be working. This fan should come on and remain on when the a/c system is operating. Struggling with the radiator fan here as well. I replaced the temperature control switch, thermostat, outlet flange, pulled the fan control module looked for corrosion, none.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/45/21/4d452141fc054b38c10bfd227172e40a.jpg alt="Free Shipping For Nmb 4715ms-23t-b30 A00 Ac 230v 1211w 2-pin 120x120x38mm Server Square Cooling Fan Computer Components Cheap Fans Cooling Fan" title="Free Shipping For Nmb 4715ms-23t-b30 A00 Ac 230v 1211w 2-pin 120x120x38mm Server Square Cooling Fan Computer Components Cheap Fans Cooling Fan" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Or the control logic that dictate which switch will control the radiator fan motor when engine temperature reach a preset level, with or without the ac being on. This fan should come on and remain on when the a/c system is operating. Yes, a broken radiator fan can cause the air conditiong to stop working. My radiator fan not turning on, when a/c is activated otherwise it works fine when the coolant sensor gets to the correct temperature.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e8/23/be/e823bec659bda99eff7a219fa7d22685.jpg alt="3 Relay Cooling Fan Wiring - - - Question Electricity Relay Electrical Circuit Diagram" title="3 Relay Cooling Fan Wiring - - - Question Electricity Relay Electrical Circuit Diagram" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If overheating is encountered when the ac is off, may mean that the temperature sensor that send control signal for the radiator fan motor may possibly be faulty. While these are some of the reasons, it is not all of them. That’s why your ac is not cool. From you description, it sounds as though the system isn’t building enough pressure, and by relation enough heat to turn the cooling fans on.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/9a/f3/699af3b8dac0190161ac12f5b1d759e4.jpg alt="Sxdool Ac Fan S254ap-11-23 110v 25489 254mm 3-wire 5060 Hz 19001450 Rpm Industrial Server Computer Pc Cooling Fans Ac Fan Cooling Fan Fan" title="Sxdool Ac Fan S254ap-11-23 110v 25489 254mm 3-wire 5060 Hz 19001450 Rpm Industrial Server Computer Pc Cooling Fans Ac Fan Cooling Fan Fan" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Or the control logic that dictate which switch will control the radiator fan motor when engine temperature reach a preset level, with or witho. So i started it back on for 20 sec. An indicator light comes on when a/c is on.
