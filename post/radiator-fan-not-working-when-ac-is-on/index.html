Leave the a/c off for the rest of the test. Or do the same resistance test as you did, but spin the fan slowly see if the resistance goes infinite at some point. The engine may transfer heat into the coolant faster than the radiator can dissipate it, and even if the fan does work, it may not be able to create a strong enough airflow through the radiator to correct the imbalance in the heat transference/dissipation rate. If the fan comes on when the air conditioning is operating at maximum volume, but doesn’t run properly when the engine is warm or hot, then you might need to check the temperature switch.

If the low side sucks into a vacuum quickly, i would suspect a low system. This is what i have done.replaced the fans (because the radiator fan was bad, after hooking them up. Or do the same resistance test as you did, but spin the fan slowly see if the resistance goes infinite at some point.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9a/40/86/9a4086d76a5d616e1035e8e4ef00d051.jpg alt="Overheating Help Testing Cooling Fans - Relays - Connections - Youtube Cooling Fan Relay Fan" title="Overheating Help Testing Cooling Fans - Relays - Connections - Youtube Cooling Fan Relay Fan" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

To check the temperature at which the fan comes on, turn the a/c off and keep the engine running until it reaches normal operating temperature. Additionally, does radiator fan affect ac? If the belt/viscous clutch fan is moving enough air (assuming your car has auto transmission), electric fan won�t run. If your radiator or cooling fan is not working and you�re trying to find ways on how to diagnose or trouble shoot the problems, then this video might give yo.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c5/68/fc/c568fc48761330e3858881ea47e88dc3.jpg alt="Cooling Fan Circuit 1 Car Mechanic Electricity Automotive Repair" title="Cooling Fan Circuit 1 Car Mechanic Electricity Automotive Repair" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This is because the radiator cooling fan creates double the amount of air that the condenser fan. If the high side spikes and the fans don’t turn on, i would suspect a problem with what is called the a/c pressure transducer (high side switch), one or both fan relays, the fan motors themselves, an ambient temperature switch or the sun sensor. When testing out out the trapped air kicked the car into high temp danger limp mode, this is the only time the fan has turned on. If it goes open, then your motor is dead.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/b8/85/87/b88587af0637c573e2f799148a06ca1c.jpg alt="Check This Out On Neweggnew Original Panasonic Fba06t24h 6015 Dc24v 011a Converter Radiator Fan Ac Fan Fan Motor Ac Fan Motor" title="Check This Out On Neweggnew Original Panasonic Fba06t24h 6015 Dc24v 011a Converter Radiator Fan Ac Fan Fan Motor Ac Fan Motor" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If overheating is encountered when the ac is off, may mean that the temperature sensor that send control signal for the radiator fan motor may possibly be faulty. So i started it back on for 20 sec. You can unplug each fan and test to see if brushes or the low speed is the culprit. Most fans should come on when the coolant reaches about 200 to 230 degrees.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b7/9d/0b/b79d0b06c95afb9c9d54b55f42d8d3d6.jpg alt="Auto Hvac Condenser Fan Circuit - Youtube Electrical Wiring Diagram Car Radiator Automotive Electrical" title="Auto Hvac Condenser Fan Circuit - Youtube Electrical Wiring Diagram Car Radiator Automotive Electrical" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Or do the same resistance test as you did, but spin the fan slowly see if the resistance goes infinite at some point. The radiator fan pulls air through the condenser, which removes the heat vapor of the refrigerant inside. I have a 1997 buick century with the same problem. After i parked and turned the truck of the fans still stayed on.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title radiator fan not working when ac is on by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
