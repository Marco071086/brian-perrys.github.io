Based on your first post i would say this may be normal for your car, but if you are not seeing the fans switch on by 101 c, i would suspect an issue likely with the cooling fan module itself or with wiring leading to it. If your coolant level is low, then it might not feel as if your car is getting cool, even with the radiator fan turned on and working. If it doesnt then we take from there.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2014/10/26/08/27/pic-6324695816341053018-1600x1200.gif alt="Why Arent The Radiator Fans Not Working Subaru Legacy Answered - Cargurus" title="Why Arent The Radiator Fans Not Working Subaru Legacy Answered - Cargurus" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: cargurus.com</p><p>The cooling fan motors work together with the cooling fan blades to pull air through the radiator. A/c blowing warm when at idle. Check to make sure the fan is getting power when the motor is warmed up. Radiator fan does not turn on when overheating. First thing to try is to switch the a/c on and see if the fan turns on but i see that you mentioned your a/c does not work.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title radiator fan not working when idle by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
