Plug your fridge back in and press the door switch. If you open the door or lid of your ge freezer and the light doesn’t work, replace the light bulb. If the light is not turning on when you open the refrigerator, try replacing the light bulb first to see if it solves the problem.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/54c-KtplXE4/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Lg Refrigerator Bulb Replacement Video In Easy Steps - Youtube" title="Lg Refrigerator Bulb Replacement Video In Easy Steps - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Check the bulb to see if it has a dark area in the bulb or has a broken and loose filament. Refrigerator not working at all. Interior light does not work no power at outlet light bulb burned out no help there! When the freezer door is opened the freezer door switch does two things, it turns on the light in the freezer and turns off the ice and water dispenser.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/owItLbKYFZA/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Fridge Light Not Working Heres Why - Youtube" title="Fridge Light Not Working Heres Why - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: youtube.com</p><p>If you open the door or lid of your ge freezer and the light doesn’t work, replace the light bulb. When the freezer door is opened the freezer door switch does two things, it turns on the light in the freezer and turns off the ice and water dispenser. This can be checked for continuity with an ohm meter. If the refrigerator water dispenser is not working, the door switch might be defective. When the bulb is good but the light is still not working, unplug the fridge and check the light socket next.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title refrigerator light not working bulb works by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
