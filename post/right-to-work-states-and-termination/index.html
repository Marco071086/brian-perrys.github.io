Source: nrtw.org</p><p>Let’s start with the legal definition of wrongful termination. Right to work laws guarantee that no person can be forced, as a condition of their employment, to join or not join the formation, nor to pay the dues associated with membership. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, association, labor organization or corporation to deduct labor organization dues, charges, fees, contributions, fines or assessments from an employee’s earnings, wages or compensation, unless the employer has first been presented with an individual written order therefor signed by the employee, which written order shall be terminable at any. In states that have adopted right to work laws, an employee may be included in a department that is unionized but has no obligation to actually join and pay dues to the union. This means that a contractual relationship between employer and employee can be terminated at any time.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/At-will_employment_-_covenant-of-good-faith-and-fair-dealing_exceptions.svg/250px-At-will_employment_-_covenant-of-good-faith-and-fair-dealing_exceptions.svg.png alt="At-will Employment - Wikipedia" title="At-will Employment - Wikipedia" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Sure right to work state or not doesn’t effect “wrongful termination” in the legal sense. Even in a state where you are a member of a union that’s not usually sued as “wrongful termination” but rather breach of contract and the union rep would handle it for you (you can also be a member of a union in a right to work state). It actually benefits the employer. Right to work laws guarantee that no person can be forced, as a condition of their employment, to join or not join the formation, nor to pay the dues associated with membership.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://iupat.org/wp-content/uploads/Right-to-Work-Is-Wrong.jpg alt="Right To Work For Less - Iupat" title="Right To Work For Less - Iupat" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The reform of the earlier legislation was the outcome of employee complaints about union shop. First, employees only have a claim for wrongful termination if they’ve been fired for an illegal reason. It actually benefits the employer. Sure right to work state or not doesn’t effect “wrongful termination” in the legal sense.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://gulisanolaw.com/wp-content/uploads/Right_to_Work_States_Map.png alt="Right To Work States Like Florida Do Not Recognize Wrongful Termination" title="Right To Work States Like Florida Do Not Recognize Wrongful Termination" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
