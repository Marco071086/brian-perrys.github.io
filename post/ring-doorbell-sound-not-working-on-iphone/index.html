Facing the same issue with my ring doorbell that was delivered to me yesterday, took off my previous basstop video doorbell then installed the ring doorbell and noticed after installation that when someone stands outside at the door and speaks into the doorbell, i can hear them from my phone but when i speak from my phone, there’s absolutely no voice output at the doorbell unit outside. Go to ring > audio > ring_app_alert_tones. To do this, you will remove the ring app from your phone, reboot your phone (turn it off/on) and then reinstall the app.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.ryananddebi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ring4-512x1024.png alt="Change Doorbell Sound On Ring App And Amazon Echo Ryan And Debi Toren" title="Change Doorbell Sound On Ring App And Amazon Echo Ryan And Debi Toren" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: ryananddebi.com</p><p>If you can hear audio from your ring doorbell on your phone, but no sound is traveling from your phone to the ring doorbell, it is possible that the ring app does not have access to your microphone. Factory resetting the device, checking your app settings, and making sure that your doorbell isn’t damaged are the three quickest solutions. Since updating to ios 13 my doorbell does not call my iphone (or that of my wife�s). Relaunch the ring app and go.
