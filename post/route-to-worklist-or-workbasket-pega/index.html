An application can automatically route assignments in a workbasket to users based on work schedules, due dates, skills, workloads, and other factors. For example, you route an assignment to the manager who approves expense reports and it appears in her worklist. Use a utility shape in a process flow to route work to a work basket. In a screenflow, the start shape is configured to route to a workbasket.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title route to worklist or workbasket pega by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
