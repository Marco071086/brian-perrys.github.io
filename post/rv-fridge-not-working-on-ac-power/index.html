The front panel will not light up and acts like its not getting any power. Both fuses check out ok.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/98/ec/41/98ec4167d227f7f39ab7d4dbcf8f8be4.jpg alt="Vevor 20l 22l 35l 45l 55l Small Car Fridge 1224v Dc 110-240v Ac Portable Mini Refrigerators Compressor Freezers Cooler For Home In 2021 Portable Refrigerator Car Refrigerator Car Cooler" title="Vevor 20l 22l 35l 45l 55l Small Car Fridge 1224v Dc 110-240v Ac Portable Mini Refrigerators Compressor Freezers Cooler For Home In 2021 Portable Refrigerator Car Refrigerator Car Cooler" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This is the fridge that works on shore power or propane when boondocking. 12v dc to the fridge is good up to the lower circuit board. The main circuit board selects ac mode if a nominal 120v is present at the board but automatically reverts to lp gas mode if not. What�s interesting is that when i bought it, it seemed to be working.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f7/74/e9/f774e9de8c231e2d5c5ce61323a8fee9.jpg alt="Dometic Cc40-acdc Cc40 Portable Refrigeratorfreezer In 2021 Portable Refrigerator Refrigerator Freezer Refrigerator" title="Dometic Cc40-acdc Cc40 Portable Refrigeratorfreezer In 2021 Portable Refrigerator Refrigerator Freezer Refrigerator" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The main circuit board selects ac mode if a nominal 120v is present at the board but automatically reverts to lp gas mode if not. It normally selected ac when ac power was available. There was an electrical system failure early in the life of the rv and the inverter was replaced.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/7d/e8/5c/7de85c5d219e2451a7a6ba79bdc04d8c.jpg alt="Propane Mini Fridge Lp Gas Car Cooler Campervan Motorhome Rv Refrigerator Home Ebay Rv Refrigerator Mini Fridge Compact Fridge" title="Propane Mini Fridge Lp Gas Car Cooler Campervan Motorhome Rv Refrigerator Home Ebay Rv Refrigerator Mini Fridge Compact Fridge" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

In your control center with all the switches you should have a bettery monitor. And the coils on the cooling unit should get very warm after a while. Selection button on the front is auto which should use ac power unless there is none. Now that we are going to head south on monday, it has decided to act up.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Zz5gTWPsD0/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Pin On Home Maintenance" title="Pin On Home Maintenance" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I have verified that we have : If the same issue that that is keeping the fridge from working on ac is present on battery, then all that work was for nothing.
