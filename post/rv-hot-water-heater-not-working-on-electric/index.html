With the power on if there is power at the element, then the element has burned out, and can be easily replaced. I forgot that i had my hot water heater circuit breaker cut off as my tank had been emptied of water. This is one of the first things to check if the water heater isn’t working. That can be a real issue.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2d/74/18/2d7418454e45283baf52070e1973d0cb.jpg alt="Clean-sediment-out-of-water-heater Water Heater Diy Water Heater Maintenance Hot Water Heater Repair" title="Clean-sediment-out-of-water-heater Water Heater Diy Water Heater Maintenance Hot Water Heater Repair" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The easiest thing to do is confirm the ac power is getting to the element terminals, which requires using a multimeter and removing the cover from the electric element. There is a fuse for this in the fuse box under the stove. That can be a real issue.
