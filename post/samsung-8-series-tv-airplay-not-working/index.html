When ios 12.3 and tvos 12.3 launched earlier this week with the updated tv app that apple first teased at its march event, samsung also rolled out support for both airplay 2 and the new tv app. I took samsung 8 as the s8 😔 so air play only works wry 8th apple products. With airplay 2 available on select samsung tv models (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021), you�ll be able to stream shows, movies, and music, and even cast images from all your apple devices directly to your tv. The samsung 8 series tv is much cheaper than other 65” tvs like the sony a8h oled, which costs a whopping $2,298.00!</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://img.global.news.samsung.com/my/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Samsung-TV_iTunes-Movies-and-TV-shows_main.jpg alt="Samsung Smart Tvs To Launch Itunes Movies Tv Shows And Support Airplay 2 Beginning Spring 2019 Samsung Newsroom Malaysia" title="Samsung Smart Tvs To Launch Itunes Movies Tv Shows And Support Airplay 2 Beginning Spring 2019 Samsung Newsroom Malaysia" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
