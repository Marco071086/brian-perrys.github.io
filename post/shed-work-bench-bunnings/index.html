Includes a black powdercoated finish, flush top and recessed bottom shelf, which is adjustable to different heights. My main work bench is made from 4x4 for the legs,4x2 for the framing and garden sleepers for the top which are bolted to the frame and were leveled with a plane.i made 3 drawers added a woodwork vice and a shelf underneath to store my tablesaw etc and doors to keep the sawdust. If you are using mobile phone, you could also use menu drawer from browser.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/5b/a3/ea/5ba3ead110a704ff555a0489ee11fd44.jpg alt="Rack It Bunnings Warehouse Storage Garage Storage Home Storage Solutions" title="Rack It Bunnings Warehouse Storage Garage Storage Home Storage Solutions" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
