If they are not receiving hot water or the temperature drops quickly, this is an indication that your water heater is experiencing a problem. Shower heads which are clogged with limescale will reduce the water flow and will prevent some electric showers from working (they need a minimum flow to work). The blockage will obviously cause the flow rate to decrease and the pump will start and stop in a pulsing manner.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/61/34/39/6134397d0367b12a5d9a0eb11cf06167.jpg alt="Weisshorn Outdoor Portable Gas Hot Water Heater Shower Camping Lpg Caravan Pump Silver In 2021 Gas Water Heater Water Heater Heater" title="Weisshorn Outdoor Portable Gas Hot Water Heater Shower Camping Lpg Caravan Pump Silver In 2021 Gas Water Heater Water Heater Heater" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The pump is not working. Someone may have used up all the hot water and the water now needs time to heat up. If your shower pump has stopped working then its important to firstly check the power supply to your shower pump.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4b/e9/69/4be969da488aa8bc533466060f1226be.jpg alt="Stuart Turner Showermate Eco Shower Pump 26 Bar Single Positive Impeller - 47341 In 2021 Pumps Water Supply Water Pipes" title="Stuart Turner Showermate Eco Shower Pump 26 Bar Single Positive Impeller - 47341 In 2021 Pumps Water Supply Water Pipes" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you have no problems using your shower or operating a dishwasher or washing machine but can’t get hot water to run a bath, the problem may be due to the type of heater you have. It may be possible that one of the heating elements in the unit is malfunctioning, which causes the appliance to make an insufficient amount of hot water. If the pump fails, you’ll be waiting for the hot water to reach you from wherever you have the tankless water heater installed. If you use a water heater, it may be experiencing an operating problem.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cf/ea/9a/cfea9a66903eaa286223b1e1f4fae833.jpg alt="Devanti Outdoor Portable Lpg Gas Hot Water Heater Shower Head 12v Water Pump Blackdefault Title In 2021 Portable Water Heater Hot Water Heater Gas Water Heater" title="Devanti Outdoor Portable Lpg Gas Hot Water Heater Shower Head 12v Water Pump Blackdefault Title In 2021 Portable Water Heater Hot Water Heater Gas Water Heater" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Run the shower with the pump running and see where the water in the tank falls to, if there�s plenty in the tank ( never goes below half way full) then its not the tank capacity or the refilling rate, if its dropping below that and another appliance kicks in, say a kitchen sink or washer/dish washer, that could be the problem, The only way we could get it to work would be to loosen off the hot water valve into the pump and bleed it until hot water came through at which point the pump would kick in. If it is a mixer shower, and i am presuming it is by the type of system you are running it sounds the he thermostatic control will have a fault if you have the manufacturer of the shower it could be as easy as replacing the thermostatic head but the easiest option is notmally to replace the whole shower unit.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9e/dc/18/9edc18234404c788bf4e84b7e41acf68.jpg alt="Bristan 20 Bar Twin Impeller End Shower Pump - Black In 2021 Bath Shower Mixer Black Pumps Pumps" title="Bristan 20 Bar Twin Impeller End Shower Pump - Black In 2021 Bath Shower Mixer Black Pumps Pumps" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Some taps are made that you may not be able to do this so the only other option may be is to connect a hose tap connection over the tap and to kink. The air will prevent a flow of water which will not trigger the pumps flow switch. Fortunately it can be easily fixed by removing the flow restrictor device.
