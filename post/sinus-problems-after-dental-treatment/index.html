The latest medical research suggests that in a small minority of cases, patients may experience maxillary sinusitis as a result. He or she will look for possible dental causes for the toothache, such as gum disease, cavities or other infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether os caused by dental caries and periapical abscess can be cured by dental treatment alone and which patients should consider surgery early.

It’s important to stay informed throughout all stages of medical procedures so that you can identify any possible issues and talk. It is also possible that between the first and second week after surgery, you may get a brief period of bleeding from your nose. Displacement of dental implants into the maxillary sinus is rare, but it primarily occurs in patients with severe pneumatization of the maxillary sinus and/or deficiency of the alveolar process. Several dental conditions are known for affecting those sinuses too, and dental implants, placed in the upper jaw, can also lead to sinus problems if they disturb or damage the cavity.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/98/86/e99886a2b35972ed10c2cd2f1717bb43.jpg alt="Pin On Dental" title="Pin On Dental" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
