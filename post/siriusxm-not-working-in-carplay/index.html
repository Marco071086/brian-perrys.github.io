I can also start playing it on the phone and it works. Ios 15 carplay not playing either spotify or apple music. Making matters worse, plugging in an iphone to carplay makes the phones gps go screwy. Unplugging it, it will find itself again and show the correct location.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/9f/5e/829f5eab4078059d685afea645468059.jpg alt="Jensen 9 Touchscreen Bluetooth 1 Din Radio W Wireless Apple Carplay-car910w In 2021 Apple Car Play Carplay Radio" title="Jensen 9 Touchscreen Bluetooth 1 Din Radio W Wireless Apple Carplay-car910w In 2021 Apple Car Play Carplay Radio" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
