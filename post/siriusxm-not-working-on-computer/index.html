Source: windowscentral.com</p><p>Same issue on two pc�s with latest insider build, and been like this for the past. Make sure the siriusxm antenna cable is not bent or broken. I don�t know how often it updates, and the channel list is dynamic enough at siriusxm that it would be a worthwhile improvement if the list doesn�t update automatically on a frequent basis. Please use copy and paste as screen shots can be hard to read. If they aren�t going to fix the bug, you should be able to force a scheduled update, which might be a good idea anyway.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/59/ab/d3/59abd38048b5f962271b2170eef2657f.jpg alt="2016-2019 Toyota Prius Entune Premium Gps Navigation Radio - Jbl Audio Yes Please In 2021 Gps Navigation Radio Navigation" title="2016-2019 Toyota Prius Entune Premium Gps Navigation Radio - Jbl Audio Yes Please In 2021 Gps Navigation Radio Navigation" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
