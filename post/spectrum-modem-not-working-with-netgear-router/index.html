Spectrum modem with nighthawk router. My netgear router r6260 connected to spectrum modem stopped working after i paid the late bill to turn wifi back on. Im trying to stay under $150 for both the modem and router if that’s doable. Leo says that when spectrum took over, they probably enabled the router side of his modem and that put it in conflict with his router.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f2/30/9f/f2309fd3e731882fc60cf5fa23695c4b.jpg alt="Netgear N600 Wifi Cable Modem Router Refurbished C3700-100nar - Renewed In 2021 Cable Modem Cable Modem Router Netgear" title="Netgear N600 Wifi Cable Modem Router Refurbished C3700-100nar - Renewed In 2021 Cable Modem Cable Modem Router Netgear" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If your device tells you its “connected, no internet,” your modem is not providing a connection. Plug the power back into the modem only and wait 5 minutes, your modem may show that the internet is back up but wait the full time anyway. Power cycle the modem and once it has synced to the internet connect the rourter to the modem and run the systme wizard to detect your internet. Disconnect your router and connect your computer directly to your modem.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/6f/fa/c46ffa43012c8ca9172b38254356bfcf.jpg alt="Pin On Lo House" title="Pin On Lo House" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I have the sac2v2s router from spectrum and i have added the port forwarding rule through the my spectrum app, but when i try to host a server on that port it cannot be accessed from outside the local network. Call and ask them to release the quarenteen. Not compatible with spectrum, verizon, at&t, centurylink, dsl providers, directv, dish and any bundled voice service;</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8a/ca/8d/8aca8d6a92aad6fe0f7a9935cc4a6564.jpg alt="Netgear Dual-band Ac1200 Router With 8 X 4 Docsis 30 Cable Modem Black C6220-100nas - Best Buy Modem Router Netgear Cable Modem" title="Netgear Dual-band Ac1200 Router With 8 X 4 Docsis 30 Cable Modem Black C6220-100nas - Best Buy Modem Router Netgear Cable Modem" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

This is what the $5 wireless service fee for so your still in the clear. $149.00*, max download speeds up to 2,000 mbps, docsis 3.1. I have also used a port forwarding tester to check, but it shows the port in question as closed.
