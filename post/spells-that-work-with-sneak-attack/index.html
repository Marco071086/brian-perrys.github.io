As others have already correctly pointed out, yes you can sneak attack with anything that has an attack roll. Spells are not finesse or ranged weapons. Booming blade and green flame blade scale up damage at the same rate (or double the rate, if getting both damages) and work perfectly fine with sneak attack. Versatile trickster works with your mage hand legerdemain to let you distract enemies with your mage hand and gain advantage on your attack!</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/92/a8/e7/92a8e7047003d866c88b2a81b057e1ae.jpg alt="Pin On Homebrew" title="Pin On Homebrew" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Raw sneak attack doesn�t work with spells. So, my players have devised a stratagem to help the rogue get sneak attack all the time. Rogue18/warlock2 would break the balance of the game. From a more mechanic and game ballancing perspective, spells already have a damage modifier that can be applied. Instead, it requires 1) an attack roll with advantage, 2) made with a ranged weapon or finesse weapon.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title spells that work with sneak attack by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
