Ant traps also might not be in the right spot where they can find them, making them noneffective as well. Ant traps and baits are truly some of the most effective ways to eliminate ants. They are not living in your house. And terro is “fast acting” so its not uncommon for it to kill the active ants so fast, the remaining nest will not want to eat any.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/86/64/8f/86648f82a9f5e3f16eb711edf7ddb260.jpg alt="Try Not To Gag But This Ant Trap Will Work Wonders In Your Home Best Pest Control Ants Pest Control" title="Try Not To Gag But This Ant Trap Will Work Wonders In Your Home Best Pest Control Ants Pest Control" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If you do not find the point of entry, it doesn�t matter how many baits you use, the ants will eventually come back, and keep coming back for a long time. Traps are better than sprays, as after sprays many insects die before taking the baits to the nest, thus the efficiency of this method is low, and this is when most users believe that ant traps are not working.
