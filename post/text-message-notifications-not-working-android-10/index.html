If your mobile network is acting up, then you will not receive any messages on your mobile. I was able to get it to work by setting a custom sound for each conversation but that sucked… when i clicked on the general notifications text not the button to turn it on or off… it showed my notification sound as “251” im assuming the update added or rearranged some files and that 251 was a placeholder… once i changed general notifications and new messages. Ensure that all notification options are enabled. Update apps, restart to safe mode and observe.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/70/7f/57/707f575e83f470aca31cffb42da1c067.jpg alt="Apple Iphone Text-bomb Bug Can Crashes Your Device Via Message Notifications Check Out The Details On The Website Iphone Texts Iphone Apple Iphone" title="Apple Iphone Text-bomb Bug Can Crashes Your Device Via Message Notifications Check Out The Details On The Website Iphone Texts Iphone Apple Iphone" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
