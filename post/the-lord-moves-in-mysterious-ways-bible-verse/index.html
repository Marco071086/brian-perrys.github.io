Chorus oh how deep is your wisdom, god you’re just and true in all your ways in every trial you. The clouds ye so much dread are big with mercy, and shall break in blessings on. He tried to share jesus with me many a time, even though i ignored his many attempts. I can�t say i�m perfect but jesus has his hands on me and the better i know him, the more i grow in him and my faith.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/d8/f7/13d8f7519d29574d49f95888534d9d2f.jpg alt="Pin On Jesus Obsessed" title="Pin On Jesus Obsessed" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
