That would certainly be enough to stop the truck under normal conditions, assuming the brake system was in good working order. When there is no air against the diaphragm the spring pushes upon the rod which goes through the bottom of the chamber to push against the service brake diaphragm the same way as air pressure when you apply the brakes from the tractor but, at this time there is no air pressure against the service brake diaphragm, only the pressure of the spring pushing against. This is a safety feature so the truck will stop, because if the pressure falls too low, the service brakes will not work.
