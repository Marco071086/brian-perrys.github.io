Since the truck works fine with other trailers and the trailer works fine with other trucks the issue must be compatibility between the brake controller and the trailer brakes. The sensor is called an accelerometer, and works as you describe, but that is not true proportional braking. Most common failure part is the switch in the dash, followed by the trailer plug then the module on the frame. There are some other issues that might be causing your problem.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/d9/d3/d1d9d3eeaf4cd1cd76e5681acf38b9be.jpg alt="Wiring Diagram Tekonsha Voyager Brake Controller 39510 In 2021 Trailer Wiring Diagram Electrical Diagram Electricity" title="Wiring Diagram Tekonsha Voyager Brake Controller 39510 In 2021 Trailer Wiring Diagram Electrical Diagram Electricity" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

A buddy had a similar issue where the trailer wouldn�t register with the truck, turns out, one of his magnets was bad.

The wheels still turn easily by hand when jacked up. The trailer not connected message will stay on the dash when you disconnect the trailer until you shut the truck off. I have connected several other trailers with same results. Check the 7 way jack on the cm flat bed to make sure the brake (pin 2) and ground (pin 1) are making good contact and the plug is tight in the jack. Using a circuit tester, like item # 3808, you should get output to the trailer brakes, blue wire.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/04/22/9c/04229ce4b393a746355b31b0e9b7ecb4--toy-hauler-camper-trailer.jpg alt="Electric Brake Control Wiring Trailer Wiring Diagram Electricity Trailer Light Wiring" title="Electric Brake Control Wiring Trailer Wiring Diagram Electricity Trailer Light Wiring" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Another solution is to use a little bungee cord to pull the cable up and towards the truck when plugged in.

The cable is attached to the tow vehicle from the travel trailer tongue area and will pull a pin if it detaches and apply the brakes on the trailer bringing it to a stop. The manual just implies it�s something with the truck. Another solution is to use a little bungee cord to pull the cable up and towards the truck when plugged in. Using a circuit tester, like item # 3808, you should get output to the trailer brakes, blue wire.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0b/36/df/0b36dfe5d8a179318051a053b57b7ae8--horse-trailers-camping-trailers.jpg alt="How To Wire A Trailer With Lights Brakes Trailer Light Wiring Trailer Small Trailer" title="How To Wire A Trailer With Lights Brakes Trailer Light Wiring Trailer Small Trailer" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

When i slide the trailer brake controller the brake lights do come on but no braking happens. That’s the theory but as trailers age, this cable and pin can corrode and needs to be inspected regularly to ensure it will work properly if ever needed. All lights on the trailer work as well. Make sure the truck and the trailer side connectors are clean and free of corrosion inside and out.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/04/f0/01/04f00138aa0eccbaa4bd456f8f16880a.png alt="How To Synchronize Trailer Brakes Rv Maintenance Camper Maintenance Rv Repair" title="How To Synchronize Trailer Brakes Rv Maintenance Camper Maintenance Rv Repair" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Apply the service brakes and make sure that you are getting service air from the tractor. Picked up my tt with my new truck for its first tow and the trailer brakes aren�t working. Normally i am able to adjust these brakes so the wheel locks up completely.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/65/d5/bf/65d5bff9a178247ecadc1352abc58d7b.jpg alt="I Need An F150 Trailer Towing Wiring Diagram - Fixya Trailer Wiring Diagram Trailer Light Wiring Trailer" title="I Need An F150 Trailer Towing Wiring Diagram - Fixya Trailer Wiring Diagram Trailer Light Wiring Trailer" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Sever the blue brake output wire, leaving enough room to splice it back together when testing is done and then apply the manual slide. Even went out and brought a new brake controller. Also, the fuse for trailer brake are in the ubec (underhood fuse block). When i connect the plug from the trailer and apply the brake the led on the controller will not come on and i have no trailer brakes.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title trailer brakes not working on truck by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
