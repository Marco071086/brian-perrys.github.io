I have a turtle beach earforce p11 headset that features a usb connector and a 3.5mm audio jack for the headphone port. The first step is to download the audio hub from the turtle beach website.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://linustechtips.com/uploads/monthly_2018_08/1803mic.png.336e0b0fd3552895e1d867a240a07435.png alt="Discord Not Detecting Headset Mic But Ps4 Does - Troubleshooting - Linus Tech Tips" title="Discord Not Detecting Headset Mic But Ps4 Does - Troubleshooting - Linus Tech Tips" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I found that at least with discord, the mic wont work if i connect the headset after discord is open. Under app volume and device preferences, locate discord and make sure the volume is. It worked fine under windows 8.1 for several months and worked fine under windows 10 up until a few days ago.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1b/9c/f3/1b9cf37adea8ca1aba0d1d7a7346781a.jpg alt="Corsair Hs70 Wireless Gaming Headset - 71 Surround Sound Headphones For Pc - Discord Certified - 50mm Drivers Car Best Gaming Headset Gaming Headset Headset" title="Corsair Hs70 Wireless Gaming Headset - 71 Surround Sound Headphones For Pc - Discord Certified - 50mm Drivers Car Best Gaming Headset Gaming Headset Headset" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
