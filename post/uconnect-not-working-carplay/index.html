Go to settings > screen time > content & privacy restrictions, tap allowed apps and make sure that carplay is enabled. Tested with aftermarket cables, original iphone cables from apple no difference.

After it, let�s try to connect your phone using carplay on your vehicle, and let�s try to play music with it! mine was set to late night.
