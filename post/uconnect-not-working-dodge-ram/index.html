It says (uconnect phone not available) when you press the phone button. After reconnecting the battery and a few key cycles, screen, uconnect, and related accessories all started working. Not all chrysler products have uconnect; This radio was equipped with sxm and i used it frequently.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/af/75/7eaf75f9cb6ea010b11ba735ad6869d8.jpg alt="Crisp And Clean Doowork707 Ram Ramtrucks Ram1500 Ramlife Ramcountry Trucks Truckdaily Ram Trucks Ram Trucks 1500 Trucks" title="Crisp And Clean Doowork707 Ram Ramtrucks Ram1500 Ramlife Ramcountry Trucks Truckdaily Ram Trucks Ram Trucks 1500 Trucks" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

I was having problems with the voice recognition not working as well as the messaging feature on the uconnect phone never working. There�s nowhere for it on this unit. Why does remote start not work on dodge ram? I checked and have the most recent uconnect software 20.04.19.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d7/ac/ce/d7acceca5437f5f15414b234680761f8.jpg alt="2019 Ram 3500 Tradesman Dually 4wd Diesel Pickup Truck Backup Camera Uconnect 3 Diesel Pickup Trucks Pickup Trucks Backup Camera" title="2019 Ram 3500 Tradesman Dually 4wd Diesel Pickup Truck Backup Camera Uconnect 3 Diesel Pickup Trucks Pickup Trucks Backup Camera" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It may show the button on the radio, but if the uconnect system isn�t installed you get the error you�re getting; Recntly, my uconnect 5.0 ra2 radio stopped working.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/21/15/5221159cdab8d31825b7bff33f0cf709.jpg alt="Pin On Ram 1500" title="Pin On Ram 1500" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
