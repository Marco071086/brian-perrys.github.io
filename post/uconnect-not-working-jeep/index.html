I posted on the ram forum as well where it seems this problem has been going of for sever years! While the 3g service is going away, uconnect support stated they are offering for free, the tmobile 4g obd adapter. I’ve been having an issue with my gps not working and the uconnect rebooting while driving.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/66/76/5d/66765d04db2b246be80a837238d870ce.jpg alt="2020 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport 30l V6 Diesel Automatic Suv Review" title="2020 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport 30l V6 Diesel Automatic Suv Review" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: id.pinterest.com</p><p>Apparently this is a known issue and was caused by a botched ota update. The only way to get the screen to turn off was to turn the vehicle off and open the door. We�re sorry to hear that you�re all experiencing similar concerns with your uconnect app recently. My jlu was at the dealership for vacuum pump replacement and 4 days later i got in and uconnect immediately recognized the ipod. Your screen will switch on again showing your trim logo;</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/74/fd/ba74fd95ae40eb719e08923d4a30b7ac.jpg alt="Jeep 2021 Wrangler Page 5 In 2021 Apple Car Play Uconnect Sound System" title="Jeep 2021 Wrangler Page 5 In 2021 Apple Car Play Uconnect Sound System" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>This is the uconnect® support page for jeep vehicles like the jeep® wrangler, gladiator & cherokee. Of course it still didn�t work. I disconnected the negative connection on battery for about an hour, and still no uconnect. In that case, updating the software or getting the uconnect firmware reinstalled might be the only solution to fix the touch screen not working on your jeep vehicle. Sorry to hear about this!</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/71/5b/8f715b1017523ebcb84cd22c1bfdcf16.jpg alt="2014-2018 Jeep Cherokee Gps Uconnect Navigation 84an Ra4 Radio Upgrade Jeep Cherokee Jeep Cherokee Limited Uconnect" title="2014-2018 Jeep Cherokee Gps Uconnect Navigation 84an Ra4 Radio Upgrade Jeep Cherokee Jeep Cherokee Limited Uconnect" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Curious to see if anyone else has had their uconnect/nav screen not turn on when turning on the car. I just got off the phone with uconnect and was told that in addition to to remote start, lock/unlock, etc., additional features that may not work are sirius xm traffic/travel link (i spoke with sirius xm and they said that it depends on the radio and they really won�t know which ones are affected until it happens), and navigation. They want me to take it into the dealership. Hey, i do not own a jeep, but i have the same problem with uconnect with my brand new 2018 ram 2500 laramie 8.4 screen. If you are still experiencing bluetooth issues after you perform the update please send us a pm with your vin so i can investigate further for you.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to submit their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title uconnect not working jeep by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
