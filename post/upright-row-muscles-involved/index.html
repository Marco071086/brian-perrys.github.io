The upright row is a compound exercise. This is a compound exercise that involves the trapezius, the deltoids and the biceps. The traps and delts work together to raise your arms, while the biceps work to flex and bend the elbow. The main muscles involved in the dumbbell upright row are the trapezius (traps), deltoids (delts), and the biceps.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d0/14/64/d01464c6ab77b2f472649926d38a42ea.jpg alt="Freefitnessguru - Upright Barbell Row Anatomy Rear Strength Training Anatomy Anatomy Muscle Anatomy" title="Freefitnessguru - Upright Barbell Row Anatomy Rear Strength Training Anatomy Anatomy Muscle Anatomy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>The actions involved in the upright row are seen in all sports which require lifting or upward pulling actions. The primary muscles involved in the upright row are the upper trapezius, deltoids and biceps. For both these motions the lateral delts and upper traps are key contributors. Compound exercises utilize multiple joint actions and, therefore, multiple muscle groups. So rather than an upright row, a high pull is commonly and preferably performed by using a wider grip, leaning forward at the hips, and pulling the weights up and back.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e2/a3/da/e2a3da34167803af9eabef9937fdb5d5.jpg alt="Wide-grip Upright Row Works Your Lateral Deltoids And Traps Can Be Harmful To Shoulders I Exercicios De Musculacao Exercicios Para Ombro Exercicios De Treino" title="Wide-grip Upright Row Works Your Lateral Deltoids And Traps Can Be Harmful To Shoulders I Exercicios De Musculacao Exercicios Para Ombro Exercicios De Treino" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>The upper trapezius and deltoids work together to elevate your shoulder girdle and raise your arms, while your biceps work to flex your elbows. Because it involves elbow flexion, upright rows do work the biceps to a degree, along with several other muscles that flex the elbow, namely brachioradialis (a muscle in the forearm) and the brachialis (a muscle in the upper arm that sits between the biceps and triceps). Compound exercises utilize multiple joint actions and, therefore, multiple muscle groups. The main muscles involved in the dumbbell upright row are the trapezius (traps), deltoids (delts), and the biceps. It helps to develop wider shoulders and a more defined upper back.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c9/51/7e/c9517eea3bdcd5c7ffc1213be3e1b021.jpg alt="Dumbbell Wide-grip Upright Row Exercise Instructions And Video Deltoids Workout Program Gym Dumbbell Upright Row" title="Dumbbell Wide-grip Upright Row Exercise Instructions And Video Deltoids Workout Program Gym Dumbbell Upright Row" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The upright row is a compound exercise. Likewise, are upright rows for shoulders or back? Working on the deltoids, rhomboids, and trapezius muscles, the upright row is perfect for building strength, muscle, and stability in the shoulder and upper back region.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title upright row muscles involved by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
