In summary, if you have a new iphone 12 not purchased directly from verizon, and you have an old verizon sim card: New sim card will not work. Just sold a a1661 iphone 7 plus, purchased from target (verizon branded, but never used on verizon) removed the cricket sim that i used for a year and sold it to a metro pcs user. I put the sim card from my android in it.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/a8/89/3fa8894725d0a720d2175803db4b6ad7.jpg alt="Iphone 7 256gb Rose Gold On Mercari Iphone Gold Models Iphone 7" title="Iphone 7 256gb Rose Gold On Mercari Iphone Gold Models Iphone 7" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Then i called verizon to officially activate it but tech support could not do it. Sometimes, removing and then replacing the sim card back into your iphone can help if your phone�s having trouble accessing cellular service. The only att iphones that work on verizon are iphone 6, 6s and se. Alternatively verizon can send you a new 5g sim card although for me everything was done virtually and i now have 5g connectivity.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/a0/36/cba0367ae14cf530a181b7a61d90ebf6.jpg alt="Apple Iphone 7 32gb Black - Fully Unlocked Apple Phone Unlocked Cell Phones Apple Iphone" title="Apple Iphone 7 32gb Black - Fully Unlocked Apple Phone Unlocked Cell Phones Apple Iphone" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Avoid extreme temperatures and magnetic fields. I don’t understand why there are so many extensive answers to this question and the answer is quite simple. It now works fine in the 5.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/e6/7a/ffe67a878ec682acef701deba1b1deb8.png alt="How To Factory Unlock Your Verizon Usa Iphone 6s Easily Safely And Permanently Via Imei Through Official Usa Iphone Samsung Galaxy Note Samsung Galaxy Note 8" title="How To Factory Unlock Your Verizon Usa Iphone 6s Easily Safely And Permanently Via Imei Through Official Usa Iphone Samsung Galaxy Note Samsung Galaxy Note 8" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
