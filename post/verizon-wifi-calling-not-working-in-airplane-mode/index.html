When putting the device on airplane mode, the wifi is turned off as well and has to be manually turned up each time. I have an iphone x and i do have wifi calling when i’m in airplane mode but the service that i’m using currently is verizon and i wanted to make sure that google fi is the same and is gonna work just fine without any issues just like what i have currently with verizon? I have verizon and my wifi calling/text is working fine in the same house where an iphone and an android at&t phones can�t make or receive any wifi calls/texts.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title verizon wifi calling not working in airplane mode by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
