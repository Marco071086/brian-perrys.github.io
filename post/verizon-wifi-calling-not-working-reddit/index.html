Have been here for 8 years with verizon and comcast. I do not see any options in the phone anywhere for wifi calling. This is a verizon phone and when i changed sims the phone rebooted and the boot logo changed but the wifi calling is not working (the toggle is there but it doesn�t work and i have my address set). In the last few months the wifi calling has stopped working well.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://internet-access-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verizon-video-calling-not-working.png alt="4 Ways To Fix Verizon Video Calling Not Working - Internet Access Guide" title="4 Ways To Fix Verizon Video Calling Not Working - Internet Access Guide" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

At the moment, we’re not offering wifi calling on our super lte networks, because the coverage is so great that we barely get any requests for extended coverage on it. This is not a localized issue, nor is it a simple outage.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site adventageous, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title verizon wifi calling not working reddit by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
