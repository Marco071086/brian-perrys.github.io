The most common volunteer need we have is for cat, dog, and small animal care, where volunteers are trained to work directly with our adoptable animals. When shelters wouldn’t let them work directly with the animals, they donated their birthday money for dog food, cat trees, or toys for the animals. We rely on dedicated volunteers to help save them all.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fd/2c/d0/fd2cd019dce50cba71162627fc21f950.png alt="Pets Adoption App Pet Adoption App Design App Design Inspiration" title="Pets Adoption App Pet Adoption App Design App Design Inspiration" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
