Your body will recover gradually after half an hour of a workout. While i’m not suggesting fasting after every workout, i think it’s worth doing occasionally. On my very first day of fasting, i woke up, took a cup of tea, and then i started my routine for the day. I stick with warm sea salted water with potassium and magnesium (many commercial electrolyte powders have either glucose or artificial sweeteners which undermine fasting benefits, but make more sense if you’re taking them to rehydrate after gi upset or intense exercise).</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/a6/6b/05a66bbc3ab954d8846a810e723f392d.jpg alt="My 3 Day Water Fast 2019 Before And After - Water Fast Benefits Water Fast Results 5 Day Water Fast Water Fasting" title="My 3 Day Water Fast 2019 Before And After - Water Fast Benefits Water Fast Results 5 Day Water Fast Water Fasting" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Typically our body stores 1 day’s worth as glycogen, but mind these couple of caveats. While most fasting practitioners recommend fasts between 5 and 14 days, i found some detailed accounts of people who had fasted for as long as 45 days and lived to tell the tale. The energy burned can disrupt the body’s ability to release toxins because the cleansing process requires energy. You will already be in ketosis and it will be so much more easier.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/34/a0/3b34a047da75672f2ab45804f479b111.jpg alt="Pin On Shape Up Now" title="Pin On Shape Up Now" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Remember to up your intake of electrolytes after exercise too.
