This is a new camper, the burner light, heated the water then shut off, bur would not reignite, i checked the 2 amp fuse it is. The bypass valve is used to turn off the hot water when winterizing. If the psi and water heater temperature are misaligned, it could be because of the age of the pressure release valve. Sometimes it is just the simple turn of a valve at the water heater itself.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ea/72/b4/ea72b4db13bc52f957ddf36eccb0e41b.png alt="Pin On Camping Gear" title="Pin On Camping Gear" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>When we first tested the water heater, electric would not work, but the propane did. Go outside and look for a lever or valve labeled water heater bypass. The bypass valve is used to turn off the hot water when winterizing. Water heaters need a 12v supply like most anything else that is electric powered, so you should test your batteries to see if they are even providing the correct voltage that you need. If the furnace still doesn’t run, try lighting a stove burner.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title water heater not working in camper by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
