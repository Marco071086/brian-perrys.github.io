I love the time in traffic on carplay tt gives and its more minimalist interface, but without an update it’s just not worth it. It crashes when it starts speaking, if the sound is routed via bluetooth as a phone call. I have to launch waze on the phone, select my destination, hit the phone�s power button to turn off the display, then connect to the usb cable for carplay.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/88/eb/b1/88ebb1bcfd4ca8ea645865fac7894146.jpg alt="Tiktok Na Wechat Kufungiwa Kwenye Masoko Ya App Marekani Zu Beschaeftigt Apps Klage" title="Tiktok Na Wechat Kufungiwa Kwenye Masoko Ya App Marekani Zu Beschaeftigt Apps Klage" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
