Music still plays from spotify, but opening the spotify app in carplay only brings up a black screen.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=http://www.blackxperience.com/assets/content/blackattitude/blacktech/waze-carplay-split-view-dasbor-mode.jpg alt="Waze Akan Segera Mendukung Mode Dasbor Split-view Carplay - Blackxperiencecom" title="Waze Akan Segera Mendukung Mode Dasbor Split-view Carplay - Blackxperiencecom" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
