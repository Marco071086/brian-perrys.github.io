Laser welding is a process used to join together metals or thermoplastics using a laser beam to form a weld. Since flux is attached to the stick electrode or fcaw electrode filler wire, it is deposited at the same time as the filler metal. Resistance welding, invented in 1877 by elihu thomson, was accepted long before arc welding for spot and seam joining of sheet. Welding is a fabrication process whereby two or more parts are fused together by means of heat, pressure or both forming a join as the parts cool.
