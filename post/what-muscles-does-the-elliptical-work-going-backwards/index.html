During the forward movement on the elliptical predominantly engages the abdominals. The muscle you use during the forward motion on an elliptical is the biceps femoris, a hamstrings muscle, and the backward motion engages the rectus femoris, a muscle in the quads, according to a report by willamette university. If performed with proper posture, the elliptical machine also strengthens core muscles in your abs and back as they contract to keep you upright and help maintain your balance. There is also a great cardio burst from working backwards.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/84/82/52/848252dac77a7ac9edcf2adffd1ab3f2--bing-bilder-kettle-bells.jpg alt="Pin On Kettle Bell" title="Pin On Kettle Bell" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

With elliptical backwards pedaling, your upper body is facing forward, opposite the direction of your movement, unlike in backwards walking/jogging or reverse stepping on a stair climber. Using the elliptical forwards works your gluts and hamstrings, while backward works your calves and quads. General muscle training elliptical machines are well known for providing an excellent cardio workout.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/23/7c/83237c9e918bdc6d9831e8f1126c63c4.jpg alt="Hiit Cardio Abs Lgloveyourselffit - Interval Treadmill Workout Hiit Cardio Workouts Cardio Abs" title="Hiit Cardio Abs Lgloveyourselffit - Interval Treadmill Workout Hiit Cardio Workouts Cardio Abs" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
