The people who already had the epidural injection(s) and you have been told that the next step is surgery because the epidural injections have limited effect and you will need something else to help you. If your pain remains unchanged, then that joint is probably not the cause of your pain. Then the doctor will inject the medication into the facet joint. Now, if you don’t experience relief from the facet joint injection at all during the diagnostic portion of this procedure, there is a chance your pain has not been identified and the cause is still unknown.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title what next if facet joint injections dont work by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
