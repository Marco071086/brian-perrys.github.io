Wait 30 seconds, then plug your refrigerator back in again. Take a look at the feeler arm or paddle to confirm it can move freely. This will allow water to drip through the fill tub going to the icemaker and it will freeze solid causing the fill tube to the icemaker to freeze.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title whirlpool refrigerator ice maker not working after filter change by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
