It takes less than 15 minutes to fix on average. If the icemaker switch does not have continuity, replace it. Once the mold reaches the proper temperature, the icemaker ejects the ice cubes and refills the ice mold with water.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/e0/ed/0be0ed311627ba5767207fdd8e5de650.jpg alt="Wrx735sdhz By Whirlpool - French Door Refrigerators Goedekerscom Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator French Door Refrigerator French Doors" title="Wrx735sdhz By Whirlpool - French Door Refrigerators Goedekerscom Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator French Door Refrigerator French Doors" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Then all you do it loosen the top two screws that hold the ice maker in place, some also have one screw on the bottom of the ice maker, that one you remove completely. Place the new filter in the slot and twist to secure.
