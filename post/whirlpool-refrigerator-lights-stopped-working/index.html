If the fridge lights work ok (brightness etc) with the freezer light disconnected (you may have to do this back at the led control board) then there is a problem with the circuit wiring to the freezer lights. My whirlpool gold fridge not working i have power lights are on digital display is on. In order to react correctly if the refrigerator has stopped working, you need to understand the causes of the malfunction.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gCcnAdbNmmUnuODt.standard alt="Solved Whirlpool Refrigerator Top Light And Freezer Light Not Working - Whirlpool Fridge French Door Ice Maker - Ifixit" title="Solved Whirlpool Refrigerator Top Light And Freezer Light Not Working - Whirlpool Fridge French Door Ice Maker - Ifixit" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: ifixit.com</p><p>The compressor stopped working just before the warranty was to expire and had to be replaced. Also, the door switch may be faulty, which may require an expert. Next day still not working, i opened doors to let air out, after 10 min i heard it. If the light board is receiving sufficient voltage, but the refrigerator light will not work, replace the light board. But you may have a more complicated problem, like the refrigerator runs constantly or is noisy.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title whirlpool refrigerator lights stopped working by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
