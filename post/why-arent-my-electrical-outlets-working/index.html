The most common reason that an electrical outlet or multiple electrical outlets stop working is a tripped afci/gfci outlet or circuit breaker. If the above causes do not apply to your faulty outlet, an electrician will need to remove it from the box and continue looking for loose connections that may be inhibiting the flow of electricity. If you suspect that any of the connectors on the outlet are loose or broken, this can lead to the outlet to no longer work properly and cause other issues on the circuit.
