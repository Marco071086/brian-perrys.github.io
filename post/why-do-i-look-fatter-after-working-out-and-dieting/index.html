Lack of exercise may make you lose weight but look fatter because if you restrict your caloric intake, and don’t work your muscles, you will start to lose muscle mass. Or, if you prefer to work out your whole body, establish a workout routine where you work your entire body one day and then take the next day to do light cardio, stretching, or complete rest.
