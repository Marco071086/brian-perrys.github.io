Check the blower motor electrical connector for corrosion,loose wires in connector,maybe not be plugged all the way in?you could check the resistor.unplug it,look to see if connector is maybe melted/burnt.usually when the resistor goes,it will only work on high speed or 1 or 2 speeds only.check blower motor fuse and relay,make sure they are plugged all the way in,and making a good connection.
