A dirty cabin air filter could be causing the problem, since air that’s not entering cleanly will cause the ac to not work at peak efficiency. The probe from the thermostatic expansion valve may be loose in the evaporator coils causing the intermittent operation. Why ac compressor pulley and bearing fails.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/33/6d/30336d67b67c44eb8e5b82585091d81f.jpg alt="How Does Car Engine Oil Work And Other Important Things To Know Oils Work Car Engine What Happens When You" title="How Does Car Engine Oil Work And Other Important Things To Know Oils Work Car Engine What Happens When You" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Take readings at the motor connector when it is working right and write them down on paper, when it stops working again, take the readings again.
