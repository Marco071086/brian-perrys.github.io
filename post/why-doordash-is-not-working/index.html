The problem is, @chipotle and @doordash�s app somehow doesn�t have a way to notify the user or anyone that the store is closed. Why is doordash not busy? But the most common problem is doordash app is not opening. When they deliver my food i can usually see them coming so i can open the door before they knock because sometimes theres someone asleep.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d6/9a/22/d69a2209e5dcc2d3e3286415ca0a13db.jpg alt="My Doordash Order Manager Redesign A Ux Case Study Case Study Branding Design Logo Doordash" title="My Doordash Order Manager Redesign A Ux Case Study Case Study Branding Design Logo Doordash" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
