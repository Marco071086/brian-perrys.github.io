There is a bug where apple pay isn�t showing unless someone uses safari in a private window, although i don�t know that it affects every site. You�ll have to call your financial institution with a number which they give you, and some shmo will have to verify the thing. Now, try to use apple pay.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://discussions.apple.com/content/attachment/a66b9ffb-ebf2-4421-8e09-e5b886f9a4b4 alt="My Apple Pay Does Not Work With Uber Eats - Apple Community" title="My Apple Pay Does Not Work With Uber Eats - Apple Community" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: discussions.apple.com</p><p>It’s definitely set up on my phone because i use it in loads of other apps. To add your bank account in the driver app, go to payments in the app menu. So in uber payment settings you can set it to default payment method and select the card. The buggaboo is that the apple pay card has to be activated. From everything i’ve seen online, apple pay is an available payment option in both uber and uber eats.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title why is apple pay not working on uber by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
