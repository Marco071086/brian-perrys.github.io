As for why dental care is so expensive in canada, it is the cost of labour, cost of materials and the cost of operating a practice. 59 per cent of private dental care expenditures, about $6.6 billion, were paid for by insurance. If you’ve ever lost a tooth, unless you had your existing insurance in place, the replacement of that tooth in the future won’t get covered. Because of this, dentists do not mind charging a lower price for their services.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.cardrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/best-credit-cards-for-dental-work-feat.png?1 alt="6 Best Credit Cards For Dental Work 2021" title="6 Best Credit Cards For Dental Work 2021" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
