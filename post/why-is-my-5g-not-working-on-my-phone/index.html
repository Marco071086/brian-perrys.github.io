In fact, some carriers don’t yet have much 5g infrastructure in place, if any at all. “my mobile data is on but not working” could be caused by a minor system glitch or an error from your mobile operator that can be fixed by rebooting your phone. It�s frustrating, i�ve updated the phone.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/b6/e1/2eb6e1afeb65512534771b304f0196f7.jpg alt="Pin On Samsung Galaxy S10 5g" title="Pin On Samsung Galaxy S10 5g" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Start by logging into the routers admin portal > basic tab and use the reboot option to gracefully restart the router. Yes i found out what was causing this issue for me. Turn on airplane mode for 30 seconds, and after a few seconds, turn it off again. Now, after some software update from samsung 5g stopped working, but only on ee and a few other european networks.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title why is my 5g not working on my phone by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
