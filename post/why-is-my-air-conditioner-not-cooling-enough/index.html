Your air conditioner can�t keep you cool when its air filters are clogged by dust, debris, or dander. There are multiple reasons for air conditioner not cooling enough. For instance, if your room’s temperature is 70 degrees, but your ac’s thermostat is set to 80 degrees, then the ac won’t cool. If this happens, your ac has less cooling and dehumidification power. Understanding how an air conditioning system works may help you diagnose the problem faster.</p><h3 id=replace-your-air-filter-if-necessary>Replace your air filter, if necessary.</h3><p>If your system is not cooling enough or running too frequently, there is a very good chance your system is not tuned up to the design specifications.
