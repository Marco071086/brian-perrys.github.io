This type of protection device is needed for all bathrooms, garages, kitchens, etc., so if the trip is not in the main breaker you should look for the gfci receptacle. Ensure that you don’t accidentally move a switch, and if you do happen to switch a breaker on or off, remember which one you moved. When a bathroom outlet stops working it is very possible that there is a gfci outlet that has tripped which causes the circuit to turn off.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/ff/73/8d/ff738dcef68f37e772270571f2a1eb6b.jpg alt="How High To Install An Outlet Above A Bathroom Vanity Gfci Home Electrical Wiring Diy Electrical" title="How High To Install An Outlet Above A Bathroom Vanity Gfci Home Electrical Wiring Diy Electrical" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The first thing i would do is check the bathroom gfci outlet to see if it needs to be reset.if the gfci outlet is ok then the circuit for the bathroom lights should be identified and turned off, then the light fixture should be removed so the wiring can be inspected to reveal the cause of the loss of power, which may be a burnt wiring splice or a faulty connection which normally supplies. You’re using an appliance and suddenly it goes dead, the lights in your bathroom go out without warning. My master bathroom outlets have stopped working. You can then return to the problem outlet and determine if resetting the breaker turned the power back on to the area.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/50/d4/2850d44dbebaaf3c3a3e055f34829037.gif alt="How Do I Replace A Gfci Receptacle In My Bathroom Outlet Wiring Electrical Wiring Basic Electrical Wiring" title="How Do I Replace A Gfci Receptacle In My Bathroom Outlet Wiring Electrical Wiring Basic Electrical Wiring" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Typically the gfci outlet will be located in one of the bathrooms near a sink. I reset the outlets, still dead. If you have more questions about tripped breakers and why your bathroom outlets don’t work, you should try to talk to a professional electrician.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your own social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title why is my bathroom outlet not working by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
