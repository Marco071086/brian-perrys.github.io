And you wait — and wait — but the heater just blows cold air. If the fan is not working, then the heating system will not be able to heat the vehicles inside fully.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/7d/cb/1e7dcbd53f133339ef8fd1eeb68bee84.jpg alt="How To Fix A Car With No Heat Easy Auto Repair No Heat Car" title="How To Fix A Car With No Heat Easy Auto Repair No Heat Car" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The heater in your car, truck or suv depends on several components in order to work pro. Its too cold now to use the car without heat. If the blower motor relay develops any sort of problem that hinders its ability to properly limit and distribute power, it may cause the blower motor fuse to blow.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/91/09/fd/9109fd03b16d652958f50eabb22ed92b.jpg alt="Engine Heater Installation Diagram Heater Radiator Fan Heat Exchanger" title="Engine Heater Installation Diagram Heater Radiator Fan Heat Exchanger" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Another reason why your car ac fan is not working could be due to your cabin air filter. Cabin air filters serve as a filter to the outside air coming into your car to make sure it is clean and not filled with contaminants. When your coolant/antifreeze levels drop, the hot fluid can’t make it to the heater core, and thus, your cabin remains chilly.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site beneficial, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title why is my car heater fan not working by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
