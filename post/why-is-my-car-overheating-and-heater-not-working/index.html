A car heater that isn�t working could be caused by several simple issues. The most common causes of overheating are problems with a vehicle’s cooling system, like low coolant levels or an issue with the circulation. If you haven’t checked the level in the overflow tank for a long time, maybe there isn’t enough coolant to keep the engine at the right temperature.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/564x/07/23/a3/0723a37605cb02339bc7b8acf62ce3c1.jpg alt="Car Cooling Systems-101 Vmrcom Automotive Mechanic Automobile Technology Engineering" title="Car Cooling Systems-101 Vmrcom Automotive Mechanic Automobile Technology Engineering" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
