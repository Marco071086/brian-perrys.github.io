The evaporator fan motor draws air over the evaporator coils and circulates it throughout the freezer. The evaporator coils are filled with frost, so air doesn’t get space to pass through them to get cold. Baffle closed and fan not running. This means that if the dometic refrigerator is not cooling but the freezer is, the issue is with the airflow.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d4/2d/83/d42d83a078a95189cfeffe3a1fe0773f.jpg alt="Flashback Retro Electrics &amp;ndash; Nostalgia Retro Red Fridge Retro Refrigerator Compact Refrigerator Compact Refrigerator Freezer" title="Flashback Retro Electrics &amp;ndash; Nostalgia Retro Red Fridge Retro Refrigerator Compact Refrigerator Compact Refrigerator Freezer" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

If the evaporator fan is not working, the freezer or refrigerator will not cool adequately. When the fridge is not cold but the freezer is, the problem is probably tied to one of your refrigerator’s mechanisms not working as designed. On most refrigerators, the fan motor will not run when the door is open.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site helpful, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title why is my freezer working but not fridge by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
