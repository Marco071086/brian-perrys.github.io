It is not only one reason that the lookup value is not available, and there should be some reasons whey vlookup formula is not working and returns errors in excel. Two different workbooks are already opened and i am trying to vlookup there i have selected lookup value in one workbook then for look array i swich to another workbook but the vlook function is not showing in another workbook. Solution 1 one solution you can try to save your worksheet so any other user cant insert columns. Also, ensure that the cells follow the correct data type.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0e/95/58/0e9558a614ae6d14b57a8d09c90ba856.jpg alt="30 Excel Functions In 30 Days Conclusion Microsoft Excel Tutorial Excel Tutorials Excel" title="30 Excel Functions In 30 Days Conclusion Microsoft Excel Tutorial Excel Tutorials Excel" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

During my days as the spreadsheet guy (oh wait, i still am the spreadsheet guy) i’d often get pinged by other analysts about why their vlookup formulas were not working. If the price list lookup table workbook is closed, the vlookup formula will still work, and the full file path for the price list lookup table workbook will be shown in the formula.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/vlookup-not-working/increased_range_resized.png alt="6 Reasons Why Your Vlookup Is Not Working" title="6 Reasons Why Your Vlookup Is Not Working" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

So you must check index_number argument if vlookup argument returns this error. In my experience, there are six main causes for this: Now when i go to the vlookup formula and select the 1st field to lookup by and then on the second option go to select my data in another workbook it doesnt allow me? However, when i use a sheet in the same workbook and use the above formula it works properly.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title why is my vlookup not working between workbooks by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
