The reason i suggested about flushing is it not only would check the heater core but also the valve and the hoses. I am not sure that the temperature readout in the vehicle is the same as used for the hvac. If the heat is blowing, but blowing cold, it has something to do with the coolant getting to the heater core, or the heater core itself.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://www.quadratec.com/sites/default/files/media/article/heating-hero.jpg alt="Four Common Reasons Your Jeep Wrangler Heater Is Not Working Quadratec" title="Four Common Reasons Your Jeep Wrangler Heater Is Not Working Quadratec" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Make sure your thermostat is set to heat. The heater control value isn’t working. At the simplest level, there are two main reasons why the heater is not working. Check your coolant level, both in the recovery bottle and radiator.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rbyAsy19cqs/hqdefault.jpg alt="Possible Reasons Your Jeep Does Not Have Heat - Youtube" title="Possible Reasons Your Jeep Does Not Have Heat - Youtube" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

From everything i found (including the relay mod that was quite popular for a time, though i wouldn�t suggest it) during my research it would appear that as the blower motor ages the voltage at the switch changes and in some mystical and magical way unbeknownst to those who don�t understand electricity (maybe just me) it causes the thermal overload that folks. Just because the heater core isn�t leaking doesn�t mean it isn�t plugged. I changed the thermostat and the coolant. Look for the simplest things first.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do sharing their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your preference social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title why isnt my heat working in my jeep by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
