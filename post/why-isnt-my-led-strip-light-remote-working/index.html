Could be your voltage is wrong for the led to operate correctly.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/52/d1/4e/52d14e1b5c5edcaf5ef27bb45d29aa8e.jpg alt="Led Strip Light Urban Outfitters Ideias De Quartos Decoracao Quartos" title="Led Strip Light Urban Outfitters Ideias De Quartos Decoracao Quartos" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
