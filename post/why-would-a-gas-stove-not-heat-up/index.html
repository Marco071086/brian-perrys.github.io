An oven that won�t heat is usually the result of a faulty igniter (for a gas oven) or heating element (for an electric oven). As the sensor heats up, it expands a valve inside the flame failure device, unrestricting the supply of gas. We have installed a fully inset multi fuel stove (stockton 7) and burned it last night for the first time. If you smell gas anywhere in your home, leave immediately, making sure not to operate any electrical appliances or turn any switches on your way out.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/37/07/5d370726c7ca399df0f3fa4e2f11d9fc.jpg alt="Pin On Home" title="Pin On Home" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
