Wait until the engine has cooled down and check the coolant level, topping it up if needed.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/05/fe/ac05fe7ea947789c3cc0f1b472492a65.jpg alt="Pin On Victorjairo0208gmailcom" title="Pin On Victorjairo0208gmailcom" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
