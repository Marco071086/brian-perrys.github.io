The radiator uses the outside air and a fan to cool the fluid in the system, while the heater core uses the heat from the coolant and a fan to warm the air inside the car. When you turn on your heater, the coolant flows through the heater core inside your dashboard. Your car’s heater uses heated engine coolant to warm the air that is blown into the cabin, while the air conditioner uses a compressor driven by the engine, combined with both high pressure and low pressure lines, special refrigerant and many other components. Your engine runs by turning a mixture of fuel and air into a series of tiny explosions, so naturally, this process generates a lot of heat—so much so, that your vehicle must also have a cooling system to prevent it from overheating.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/52/94/4b/52944be6832e15c15456d17acdd276d2.jpg alt="Need For Speed Heat Review Nfs Is Heating Up The Franchise Again Need For Speed Cars Need For Speed Custom Cars" title="Need For Speed Heat Review Nfs Is Heating Up The Franchise Again Need For Speed Cars Need For Speed Custom Cars" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

The radiator uses the outside air and a fan to cool the fluid in the system, while the heater core uses the heat from the coolant and a fan to warm the air inside the car. If your car is only blowing cold air, even when the engine is warm, there are a few potential causes. When you turn on your heater, the coolant flows through the heater core inside your dashboard.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/50/aa/73/50aa73f969c402717ffbcffe12b43e82.jpg alt="Comfort Group Give Best Advise On Heat Pumps Thames Woman Mechanic Car Fuel Economy" title="Comfort Group Give Best Advise On Heat Pumps Thames Woman Mechanic Car Fuel Economy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Faulty thermostat a faulty or broken thermostat is. When your vehicle is in motion and driving down the road, then engine coolant temperature tends to get hotter on the engine before it gets to the radiator, so the heater will naturally heat up more when driving around. In the case of windows absorbing most of the heat, the interior will be no warmer than the interior air temperate. The heater is higher up than the rest of the cooling system, and thus last in line for coolant.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/bd/d7/77bdd74220fd66048fa34d62a435d973.jpg alt="Need For Speed Heat Wallpaper Hd Phone Backgrounds Cars Poster Art On Iphone Android Lock Screen Need For Speed Cars Need For Speed Futuristic Cars" title="Need For Speed Heat Wallpaper Hd Phone Backgrounds Cars Poster Art On Iphone Android Lock Screen Need For Speed Cars Need For Speed Futuristic Cars" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Your engine runs by turning a mixture of fuel and air into a series of tiny explosions, so naturally, this process generates a lot of heat—so much so, that your vehicle must also have a cooling system to prevent it from overheating. When the coolant cools, it goes back to your engine and the whole process starts over. Radiator fluid runs through the engine and becomes hot. When your vehicle is in motion and driving down the road, then engine coolant temperature tends to get hotter on the engine before it gets to the radiator, so the heater will naturally heat up more when driving around.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6c/20/e2/6c20e2fa800519a007ca431d9246cbf1.jpg alt="Khyzyl Saleem Art - Nfs Heat Polestar 1 Coverhero Car Design Need For Speed Cars Pole Star Car Design" title="Khyzyl Saleem Art - Nfs Heat Polestar 1 Coverhero Car Design Need For Speed Cars Pole Star Car Design" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

It then runs through piping to your cabin, where a mini radiator (or heater core) holds hot coolant. There is no battery to operate the blower. The heat that is absorbed now has to make its way back out of the car, and its a much further path to take, so it takes longer. The coolant absorbs the heat from the engine, causing it to become hot.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0d/4b/af/0d4baf6932c52f8714dcff3712df075f.jpg alt="Artstation - Need For Speed Heat Pause Menu Lighting Criterion Games Need For Speed Cars Need For Speed Cool Cars" title="Artstation - Need For Speed Heat Pause Menu Lighting Criterion Games Need For Speed Cars Need For Speed Cool Cars" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Coolant (which is a mix of water and antifreeze) is what circulates around the car’s engine. When your vehicle is in motion and driving down the road, then engine coolant temperature tends to get hotter on the engine before it gets to the radiator, so the heater will naturally heat up more when driving around.
