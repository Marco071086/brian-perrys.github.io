If your wifi is working properly but your wired ethernet connection isn�t, here�s a bunch of things you can do. Let me tell you my setup to start off: I.e., dhcp enabled, default gateway 192.168.0.1, dhcp server 192.168.0.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, dns server 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (google), etc. The wifi works flawlessly, but i get unidentified network when i plug the ethernet cable in.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fc/d2/98/fcd29883d2c522bcb9153f16863a30c1.jpg alt="Ethernet Network Cable Rj45 Internet Lan Patch Lead Cat5e Snagless Wholesale Lot Ebay Network Cable Ethernet Cable Rj45" title="Ethernet Network Cable Rj45 Internet Lan Patch Lead Cat5e Snagless Wholesale Lot Ebay Network Cable Ethernet Cable Rj45" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

From the command prompt run nslookup <a href=http://www.whatever.com>www.whatever.com</a> replace the whatever with one site that works from wifi but doesn�t from wired. I.e., dhcp enabled, default gateway 192.168.0.1, dhcp server 192.168.0.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, dns server 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (google), etc. If you see that, there is some wear and tear in the cable, which may be an indication of poor connection.

Connect the cable to another port if available, or connect the cable to another device. When i first started with windows 10 on release day i was using wifi with no problems and when going the ethernet route it was always plug n play when you going to wifi vs wired. 1) find the make and model of the wifi chip you have 2) then go to the vendor�s website, find support and look for downloads 3) download the appropriate driver, install and then reboot. Wifi works with anything, but the threaded wont work with anything.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site value, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title wifi works but not ethernet cable by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
