Side effects generally go away after a few days or a few weeks, but if they’re bothersome or serious, call your doctor to discuss your treatment options. Zoloft (sertraline hcl) is an ssri antidepressant manufactured by pfizer. When i was off prozac and needed a pschy doctor to get me some…she told me it would take 3 weeks to work…which is not tru.

Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Prozac is an antidepressant drug in the class called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or ssris. Sertraline hcl is often prescribed to treat depression and anxiety. Yeah it works very fast.in the first 10 days i saw a drastic change in my negativiti3s this keep a on getting better until we become somewhat normal or neutralized from negativity. Some women can get away with only using the prozac during the times of the month when their simptoms are bad. I think certain meds work faster for some people and others not as fast.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c2/a1/37/c2a137ecac31b236182047cd3c247099.jpg alt="Prozac Turkey Funny Card Ad Ad Turkey Prozac Card Funny Funny Cards Funny Cards" title="Prozac Turkey Funny Card Ad Ad Turkey Prozac Card Funny Funny Cards Funny Cards" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
