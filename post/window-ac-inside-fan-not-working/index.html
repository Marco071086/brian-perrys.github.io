The on switch means that the fans will run continuously, and not according to the thermostat. Fan mode on ac is simply a setting on your air conditioner that keeps the blower fan running regardless of whether the cool air is on or not.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title window ac inside fan not working by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
