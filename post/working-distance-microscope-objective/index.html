They have achieved the best combination of working distance and optical performance by using a new approach—avoiding outdated conventions used by competitors.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/e2/e2/40e2e2400b81aafd116652e1b7ab249a.jpg alt="One Set 4x 10x 40x 100x 195 Mm Conjugate Distance Hd Din Achromatic Objective Lens For Biological Microscope 160017 Biological Microscope Lens Glassware" title="One Set 4x 10x 40x 100x 195 Mm Conjugate Distance Hd Din Achromatic Objective Lens For Biological Microscope 160017 Biological Microscope Lens Glassware" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Metallographic sample cutting machine, metallographic grinding machine, metallographic microscope, pp prepreg cutting machine, lind width testing machine, panel thickness testing machine, peel strength testing machine, gel timer, pp sheet, filter cartridge. A short working distance results in a smaller depth of field, while a longer working distance, as when focusing at the farthest point from the lens, creates a higher depth of field where almost everything before that point is in focus. Also, remember that with increased focal length (working distance) more of the objective will be in view. It is the decision of the microscope main components of the resolution and image clarity.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/04/e1/06/04e10653293ab67910754fb2c677ebf6.jpg alt="Standard 4x010 Din 160017 Achromatic Objective Lens Conjugate Distance185 Din 4x Achromatic Ob Microscope Objective Usb Flash Drive Biological Microscope" title="Standard 4x010 Din 160017 Achromatic Objective Lens Conjugate Distance185 Din 4x Achromatic Ob Microscope Objective Usb Flash Drive Biological Microscope" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

Working distance is the vertical distance that must be between the tip of the microscope objective lens and the part of the specimen you wish to view through the microscope, in. The objectives are called “plan” because they produce the flat image across the field of view. The clearance distance between the closest surface of the cover glass and the objective front lens is termed the working distance. This is often required when a specimen is embedded in thick slides or below thick glass plates.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/8e/8b/3b8e8b2d21004f22e6e7ee65711837bc.jpg alt="Zeiss Objective Chart Macro Lens Photography Photography Camera Macro Photography Art" title="Zeiss Objective Chart Macro Lens Photography Photography Camera Macro Photography Art" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>

To simply put, the working distance of a microscope is the distance between the subject and the lower part of your microscope. Motic�s long working distance objectives provide longer working distance than standard objective lenses without sacrificing magnification or resolution.

Motic�s long working distance objectives provide longer working distance than standard objective lenses without sacrificing magnification or resolution. To simply put, the working distance of a microscope is the distance between the subject and the lower part of your microscope.
