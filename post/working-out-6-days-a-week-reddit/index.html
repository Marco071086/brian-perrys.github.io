All these routines are three days a week and will make you big and strong. Infact for a brief period of 1 year, at isb, i even enjoyed a 4 day week. If that stalls, use bill starr 5x5 intermediate.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://preview.redd.it/p3gg3jrrmst21.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8baf6fca638043ccd3a9ea34c006e0f7436337ec" alt="Old Time Reddit Member New Name Cause I Forgot My Password 168 Working Out 6 Days A Week Results So Far Sep 18 - Apr 19 Rintermittentfasting" title="Old Time Reddit Member New Name Cause I Forgot My Password 168 Working Out 6 Days A Week Results So Far Sep 18 - Apr 19 Rintermittentfasting" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
