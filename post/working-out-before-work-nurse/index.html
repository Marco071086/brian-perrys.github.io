Years of workout out after work and a few hours before bedtime have my body used to going to sleep a couple hours after the workout. As a nurse we teach you should weigh in once a week, in the morning, before food, after a shower, stark naked and always at the same time (as close as possible). Even 30 minutes of exercise before work will leave you energized, clear headed, stronger, and more able to take on the stress of the day.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/thmb/7tyENyCnXDxYFguD3_qqFKcBxFg=/5760x3240/smart/filters:no_upscale%28%29/nurse-reviewing-medical-chart-with-patient-holding-inhaler-609179941-576867b83df78ca6e42296b4.jpg" alt="Nursing Interviews Why Do You Want To Work Here" title="Nursing Interviews Why Do You Want To Work Here" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://brian-perrys.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
